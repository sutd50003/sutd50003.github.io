The <code>screen</code> object allows us to make reference to the screen rendered in the test environment.  The <code>getByText()</code> method takes a regex pattern which search for the text \"submit\" in upper or lower cases. The result is stored in the variable <code>button</code>. Finally we assert that the button can be found in the rendered document.  We argue that the above test case is leaning towards the visual test category. </p> <p>We recall another component used in the <code>Echo</code> app, <code>MessageList</code>. </p> <pre><code>function MessageList({messages}) {\n    let rows = [];\n    for (let i in messages) {\n        rows.push(\n            &lt;tr key={messages[i].time}\n                data-testid={messages[i].time}&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;{messages[i].time}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{messages[i].msg}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n        );\n    }\n    return (\n        &lt;table data-testid=\"message-list\"&gt;\n            &lt;tbody&gt;\n                &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Message&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n                {rows}\n            &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        &lt;/table&gt;\n    )\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For the ease of reference, we give some test ids to the data rows and the table.  We now can derive the following case.  <pre><code>test('No message is rendered in empty MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgs = [];\n    render(&lt;MessageList messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(table.firstElementChild.children.length == 1); // only contains the header row.\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the above test case, we render a <code>MessageList</code> component with an empty message list.  We expect the table's <code>tbody</code> element should contains only one row, which is the the header row.</p> <p>In the next test case, we instantiate a <code>MessageList</code> component with a singleton message list and expect that the  table should contains the message. <pre><code>test('A message is rendered in a singleton MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"hello\";\n    const msgTime = (new Date()).toString();\n    const msg = { time : msgTime, msg: msgTxt };\n    const msgs = [msg];\n    render(&lt;MessageList \n            messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n    expect(table.contains(row));\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that both of the test cases are functional tests.</p> <p>Finally let's consider testing the <code>Echo</code> component. Recall that,</p> <pre><code>function Echo({http_addr}) {\n    const [msgTxt, setMsgTxt] = useState(\"\");\n    function handleSubmitClick() {\n        submitNewMessage();    \n    }\n    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n    async function submitNewMessage() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/submit`,\n        {\n            method: 'POST',\n            body: `msg=${msgTxt}`,\n            headers: {\n                'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n            }              \n        });\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n\n    async function initMessages() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/all`);\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n    useEffect( () =&gt; {\n        initMessages();\n    }, []);\n\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;NewMessageBar message={msgTxt} onMessageChange={setMsgTxt} onSubmitClick={handleSubmitClick}/&gt;\n            &lt;MessageList messages={messages}/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code snippet, we abstract the backend API URL via the <code>http_url</code> variable, for ease of mocking the API host.</p> <p>We define two test cases of the <code>Echo</code> component in the <code>Echo.test.js</code> test file as follows.</p> <pre><code>import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport './jest.polyfills'\nimport {http, HttpResponse} from 'msw'; \nimport {setupServer} from 'msw/node';\nimport Echo from './Echo';\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n    http.get('/echo/all', () =&gt; {\n      return HttpResponse.json(\n        [{'msg':'hello','time':'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'}])\n    }),\n    http.post('/echo/submit', () =&gt; {\n        return HttpResponse.json(\n          [{msg:'hello',time:'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'},\n           {msg:'bye', time:'2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z'}\n          ])\n      }),\n    )\n\nbeforeAll(() =&gt; server.listen())\nafterEach(() =&gt; server.resetHandlers())\nafterAll(() =&gt; server.close())\n\n\ntest('testing initMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n\n});\n\ntest('testing submitNewMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"bye\";\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    const textbox = screen.getByLabelText('echo-message');\n    const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);\n    fireEvent.change(textbox, {target: {value: msgTxt}});\n    await userEvent.click(submitButton);\n    expect(textbox.value).toBe(msgTxt);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n})\n</code></pre> <p>As we want to isolate the test from the backend API, we need to mock the API calls. This is achieved by using the library <code>msw</code>. </p> <p>Due to some API deprecation, to import <code>msw</code> with versions of Jest and React we are currently using we need to introduce some extra configuration for Jest in <code>jest.polyfills</code>. For details setup, please refer to this file.</p> <p><code>setupServer()</code> functions allows us to define a mock backend API server with the required endpoints.  The first test case <code>'testing initMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the first rendering of the <code>Echo()</code> component.  We want to ensure that the table contains a row with the message returned by the mocked API <code>/echo/all</code>.  The second test case <code>'testing submitNewMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the user action of entering the message \"bye\" in the textbox and clicking the submit button. We want to assert that the table contains a row with the new message returned by the mocked API <code>/echo/submit</code>. </p>"},{"location":"notes/l10_1_ui_testing/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li><code>https://testing-library.com/docs/</code></li> <li><code>https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro</code></li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/l10_1_ui_testing/#cohort-exercise-non-graded","title":"Cohort Exercise (Non graded)","text":"<p>Continue with your solution to Cohort Exercise 8 question 2, develop unit test cases for the React components found in the HR app.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l10_1_ui_testing/#ui-based-end-to-end-testing","title":"UI-based end-to-end testing","text":"<p>An end-to-end (E2E) testing is assess the built system's feature from the user's perspective.

When there is a function call, a new frame is placed on-top of the call stack. Local variables with primitive values are stored inside the frame. The frame is then popped when the function returns. The <code>main</code> frame is popped when all instructions in the JavaScript program has been executed.

It is executing an event-loop, in which it periodically check whether there is anything is the callback queue. At this point in time the browser continues to render the HTML page. When the HTML document is fully rendered, the browser triggers an <code>DomContentLoaded</code> event. At this point the callback function <code>run</code> associated with the event is enqueued to the callback queue.

(We don't need to import it when the code is executed in the browser as all browser has <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class builtin in the run-time, but this is not the case for node.js).</li> <li>In the second statement, we instantiate an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object.</li> <li>In the third line, we read the command line arguments into a variable <code>args</code>. Remember that we can pass the argument when executing the file. For example, if the filename is <code>index.js</code>, then we can execute <code>node index.js abcd</code> in the terminal. In this example, <code>abcd</code> is the command line argument.</li> <li>The following <code>if-else</code> statement checks whether the user supplies an argument. The <code>node</code> and <code>index.js</code> are counted, so the length must be 3.</li> <li>In the <code>if</code> body, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.</li> <li>Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the HTTP Request state is changed. As we discussed earlier, the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the call stack for execution. Read about <code>.onreadystatechange</code> here and <code>readyState</code> property here. Basically, HTTP request has several states, and the last state is state 4 (DONE) which means that the data transfer has been completed (response received) or failed.</li> <li>In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is done, we extract the response text and print it out.</li> <li> <p>After setting up the callback function, we <code>open</code> the request and submit it. In this example, we send a request to postman-echo which allows us to test sending a request as a client. The API will return a JSON response.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we execute this script, we will observe the API request's response being printed on the command line.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Next let's consider another example that interacts with file system via the <code>node:fs</code> library (which is a builtin module).</p> <pre><code>import { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\nconst txt = \"hello\";\nwriteFile(\"save.txt\", txt, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>At line 2, we define the text data to be written to the file.</li> <li>At line 3, we write the result to a file named <code>save.txt</code>, note that <code>writeFile()</code> takes three arguments. The last argument is a callback function, whose argument <code>err</code> is potentially an error. In this case, when the error is present, we propagate the error by throwing it as an exception, otherwise, we print a message.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/l4_2_nodejs/#callback-pyramid","title":"Callback Pyramid","text":"<p>Let's say now we would like to combine the two examples, first we would like to make an API call, when the call is returned successfully, we save the result of the API call into a file.</p> <pre><code>import XMLHttpRequest from \"xhr2\";\nimport { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\n\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nvar args = process.argv;\nif (args.length &gt; 2) {\n  var input = args[2];\n  xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {\n    if (xhr.readyState == 4) {\n      var res = xhr.responseText;\n      writeFile(\"api_result.txt\", res, (err) =&gt; {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n      });\n    }\n  };\n  xhr.open(\"GET\", `https://postman-echo.com/get?x=${input}`);\n  xhr.send();\n} else {\n  console.log(\"USAGE: node index.js input\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that we have to \"embed\" the routine of writing the result <code>res</code> into a file <code>api_result.txt</code> deep inside the callback of <code>xhr</code> request, the <code>writeFile()</code> call itself has another callback.

This function argument is called the executor. An executor function is a higher order function that takes two functions as arguments, commonly named as <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. <code>resolve</code> is applied to the result of the promise during normal execution, <code>reject</code> is applied when some error occurs. The function body of executor is executed synchronously while <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> are asynchronous and queued into microtask. Look at the simple <code>Promise</code> example below which is not using <code>reject</code>, but only <code>resolve</code>.</p> <pre><code>// executor is executed synchronously when promise object is initialized with \"new\" keyword.\n// Console will print \"Hello\" when this code below is run\nlet alwaysWork = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  resolve();\n});\n\n// resolve() and reject() functions are the argument passed to .then() or .catch()\nalwaysWork.then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Explanations:</p> <ul> <li><code>function (resolve, reject) { console.log(\"Hello\"); resolve();</code> is the executor.</li> <li>We can think of <code>Promise</code> in JS as this way: \"I want to run a piece of code (everything defined inside executor, synchronously). At the end of the code execution, I will either reach a success or failed state. If success, I would like to execute the <code>resolve()</code> function, otherwise I will execute <code>reject()</code>. I don't know yet what is the <code>resolve()</code> function. It will be provided when a function is passed as an argument to <code>.then()</code>. Same thing for <code>reject()</code>, which depends on function passed to <code>.catch()</code>\".</li> <li>In the example above, we use the anonymous function for <code>resolve()</code>, which is <code>() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\")</code>. This function is queued into microtask.</li> <li>However, it is logical that <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> can be a code that queues task to macrotask (e.g. you can have <code>setTimeout()</code> inside the function argument for <code>.then()</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider a more complicated example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(++count);\n  });\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter.then(incr).then(incr).then(incr);\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>In the above we instantiate an asynchronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable <code>count</code> and return a promise object that immediately <code>resolve</code> with the variable.</li> <li>Do you notice that we use closure here?</li> <li>Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the argument of <code>.then</code>. In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the new promise while incrementing <code>count</code> by 1.</li> <li>Fun-but-important fact: you can simply write the return statement of <code>incr()</code> function as <code>return ++count;</code>. JavaScript intrisically turn the returned value as a promise object resolved with returned value. We use this approach sometimes in the notes.</li> </ul> <p>When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes so that the we will stop incrementing the counter when a limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr()</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (count &gt; 1) {\n      reject(\"limit reached\");\n    } else {\n      resolve(++count);\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call.</p> <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n</code></pre> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>You might argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here.</p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function and creating a second counter.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(id) {\n  return function (count) {\n    console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      if (count &gt; 1) {\n        reject(\"limit reached\");\n      } else {\n        resolve(++count);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter1 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter1\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nlet counter2 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter2\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\nconsole.log(\"main done!\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle. Note that <code>nextTick()</code> queue the callback to macrotask. When executing the above example, we observe</p> <pre><code>main done!\nc1:0\nc2:0\nc1:1\nc2:1\nc1:2\nc2:2\nrejected: limit reached.\nrejected: limit reached.\ntick!\n</code></pre> <p>It reveals that the execution of the <code>incr</code> method calls for both promise objects are interleaved. The <code>tick</code> message shows that all these happens in one single event loop cycle because all the microtask from <code>promise</code> are executed before dequeueing macro task from the <code>nextTick()</code>.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code>. Open <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</code> in a browser. It will display the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login.

Each object in <code>staff</code> is a document with <code>sid</code> and <code>name</code> as attributes. e.g.</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"code\": \"HR\",\n  \"staff\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"name\": \"aaron\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"name\": \"betty\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Approach two: Storing <code>staff</code> as a separate collection from <code>dept</code>. The <code>staff</code> attribute in the <code>dept</code> document should contains only the ids of the staff. A <code>dept</code> document</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"code\": \"HR\",\n  \"staff_ids\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A <code>staff</code> document contains <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>dept_code</code> attributes.</p> <pre><code> {\n   'id': 1,\n   'name': 'aaron'\n   'dept_code': 'HR'\n }\n</code></pre> <p>Both design will work. The advantage of the first approach is that all the information are now stored in one collection, it is easier to ensure the data consistency, while the downside is that as the conceptual model becomes complex, we might have documents with too many level of nesting. Approach two avoids the deep nesting of the document structure, however, to maintain the data consistency requires additional checking and validation in the application.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#cohort-exercises","title":"Cohort Exercises","text":"<p>Using MongoDB document example, can you give a logical design of the ER diagram with the <code>Staff</code> and <code>Dept</code> entities and <code>Work</code> and <code>Manage</code> relationships?</p> <p>Can you implement a web app with the correspondent end-point (routes) handlers to support</p> <ol> <li>add and update <code>staff</code></li> <li>add <code>dept</code></li> <li>find <code>staff</code>s by department code</li> <li>find <code>staff</code>s by staff id</li> </ol>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#some-special-cases-of-er-diagrams","title":"Some special cases of ER diagrams","text":"<p>There are some difficult cases of ER diagrams to be modeled in document database in general,</p> <p>For instance a ternery relationship below  For simplicity, we omitted the attributes of the entities.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code>. Open <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</code> in a browser. It will display the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically. With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

For the submit button, we can use <code>submit</code> type. The <code>action</code> attribute of the form element indicates the destination of the end point. Below the form, we have an HTML order list element <code>ol</code>, whose content will be generated via the embedded javscript template language. In this case, we expect that the route handler will return a list of objects containing <code>title</code> and <code>messages</code> attributes. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into a sequence of list items <code>li</code>. Within each <code>li</code> element, we render the message's time and text.</p> <p>Next we update the <code>routes/echo.js</code> as follows</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\"); // existing\nconst model = require(\"../models/message.js\"); // existing\nvar router = express.Router(); // existing\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\nrouter.get(\"/:msg\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // existing\n  const msg = req.params.msg;\n  const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n  await model.insertMany([message]);\n  const messages = await model.all();\n  console.log(messages);\n  res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nrouter.get(\"/\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // updated\n  const messages = await model.all();\n  res.render(`echoform`, { title: \"Echo App\", messages: messages });\n});\n\nrouter.post(\"/submit\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // new\n  const msg = req.body.message;\n  const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n  await model.insertMany([message]);\n  res.redirect(\"/echo\");\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router; // existing\n</code></pre> <p>In the second routing rule, we listen to the local URL path <code>/echo/</code>, and retrieve all the messages, and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template.

We expect the table's <code>tbody</code> element should contains only one row, which is the the header row.</p> <p>In the next test case, we instantiate a <code>MessageList</code> component with a singleton message list and expect that the  table should contains the message. <pre><code>test('A message is rendered in a singleton MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"hello\";\n    const msgTime = (new Date()).toString();\n    const msg = { time : msgTime, msg: msgTxt };\n    const msgs = [msg];\n    render(&lt;MessageList \n            messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n    expect(table.contains(row));\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that both of the test cases are functional tests.</p> <p>Finally let's consider testing the <code>Echo</code> component. Recall that,</p> <pre><code>function Echo({http_addr}) {\n    const [msgTxt, setMsgTxt] = useState(\"\");\n    function handleSubmitClick() {\n        submitNewMessage();    \n    }\n    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n    async function submitNewMessage() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/submit`,\n        {\n            method: 'POST',\n            body: `msg=${msgTxt}`,\n            headers: {\n                'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n            }              \n        });\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n\n    async function initMessages() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/all`);\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n    useEffect( () =&gt; {\n        initMessages();\n    }, []);\n\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;NewMessageBar message={msgTxt} onMessageChange={setMsgTxt} onSubmitClick={handleSubmitClick}/&gt;\n            &lt;MessageList messages={messages}/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code snippet, we abstract the backend API URL via the <code>http_url</code> variable, for ease of mocking the API host.</p> <p>We define two test cases of the <code>Echo</code> component in the <code>Echo.test.js</code> test file as follows.</p> <pre><code>import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport './jest.polyfills'\nimport {http, HttpResponse} from 'msw'; \nimport {setupServer} from 'msw/node';\nimport Echo from './Echo';\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n    http.get('/echo/all', () =&gt; {\n      return HttpResponse.json(\n        [{'msg':'hello','time':'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'}])\n    }),\n    http.post('/echo/submit', () =&gt; {\n        return HttpResponse.json(\n          [{msg:'hello',time:'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'},\n           {msg:'bye', time:'2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z'}\n          ])\n      }),\n    )\n\nbeforeAll(() =&gt; server.listen())\nafterEach(() =&gt; server.resetHandlers())\nafterAll(() =&gt; server.close())\n\n\ntest('testing initMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n\n});\n\ntest('testing submitNewMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"bye\";\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    const textbox = screen.getByLabelText('echo-message');\n    const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);\n    fireEvent.change(textbox, {target: {value: msgTxt}});\n    await userEvent.click(submitButton);\n    expect(textbox.value).toBe(msgTxt);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n})\n</code></pre> <p>As we want to isolate the test from the backend API, we need to mock the API calls. This is achieved by using the library <code>msw</code>. </p> <p>Due to some API deprecation, to import <code>msw</code> with versions of Jest and React we are currently using we need to introduce some extra configuration for Jest in <code>jest.polyfills</code>.

The first test case <code>'testing initMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the first rendering of the <code>Echo()</code> component.  We want to ensure that the table contains a row with the message returned by the mocked API <code>/echo/all</code>.  The second test case <code>'testing submitNewMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the user action of entering the message \"bye\" in the textbox and clicking the submit button.

For instance, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the opening tag and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> is the closing. The children of an elemnent can be elements or texts. However there are a set of rules governing what contents could appear in a given element. In the above example, the content of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element consists of a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. Element without child/content can be written in a short form, e.g. <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;</code> is a short hand of <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;</code>. Note that <code>charset=\"utf-8\"</code> denotes an attribute of this <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>The HTML document in the above example defines a structure as follows,</p> <ul> <li>html</li> <li>head<ul> <li>meta</li> <li>title</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> <li>body<ul> <li>paragraph</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"%0D/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#css","title":"CSS","text":"<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a language used in describing the presentation of a document.

For all applicable elements, we want to set the margin to be 10 pixel wide. The second rule applies to a particular element with id = <code>#msg1</code>. Note that ids in an HTML document must be unique. In this rule, we want to set the font family of the text contained in the applicable elements to <code>Courier New</code>.

(We don't need to import it when the code is executed in the browser as all browser has <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class builtin in the run-time, but this is not the case for node.js).</li> <li>In the second statement, we instantiate an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object.</li> <li>In the third line, we read the command line arguments into a variable <code>args</code>. Remember that we can pass the argument when executing the file. For example, if the filename is <code>index.js</code>, then we can execute <code>node index.js abcd</code> in the terminal. In this example, <code>abcd</code> is the command line argument.</li> <li>The following <code>if-else</code> statement checks whether the user supplies an argument. The <code>node</code> and <code>index.js</code> are counted, so the length must be 3.</li> <li>In the <code>if</code> body, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.</li> <li>Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the HTTP Request state is changed. As we discussed earlier, the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the call stack for execution. Read about <code>.onreadystatechange</code> here and <code>readyState</code> property here. Basically, HTTP request has several states, and the last state is state 4 (DONE) which means that the data transfer has been completed (response received) or failed.</li> <li>In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is done, we extract the response text and print it out.</li> <li> <p>After setting up the callback function, we <code>open</code> the request and submit it. In this example, we send a request to postman-echo which allows us to test sending a request as a client. The API will return a JSON response.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we execute this script, we will observe the API request's response being printed on the command line.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Next let's consider another example that interacts with file system via the <code>node:fs</code> library (which is a builtin module).</p> <pre><code>import { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\nconst txt = \"hello\";\nwriteFile(\"save.txt\", txt, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>At line 2, we define the text data to be written to the file.</li> <li>At line 3, we write the result to a file named <code>save.txt</code>, note that <code>writeFile()</code> takes three arguments. The last argument is a callback function, whose argument <code>err</code> is potentially an error. In this case, when the error is present, we propagate the error by throwing it as an exception, otherwise, we print a message.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"%0D/l4_2_nodejs/#callback-pyramid","title":"Callback Pyramid","text":"<p>Let's say now we would like to combine the two examples, first we would like to make an API call, when the call is returned successfully, we save the result of the API call into a file.</p> <pre><code>import XMLHttpRequest from \"xhr2\";\nimport { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\n\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nvar args = process.argv;\nif (args.length &gt; 2) {\n  var input = args[2];\n  xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {\n    if (xhr.readyState == 4) {\n      var res = xhr.responseText;\n      writeFile(\"api_result.txt\", res, (err) =&gt; {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n      });\n    }\n  };\n  xhr.open(\"GET\", `https://postman-echo.com/get?x=${input}`);\n  xhr.send();\n} else {\n  console.log(\"USAGE: node index.js input\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that we have to \"embed\" the routine of writing the result <code>res</code> into a file <code>api_result.txt</code> deep inside the callback of <code>xhr</code> request, the <code>writeFile()</code> call itself has another callback.

The function body of executor is executed synchronously while <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> are asynchronous and queued into microtask. Look at the simple <code>Promise</code> example below which is not using <code>reject</code>, but only <code>resolve</code>.</p> <pre><code>// executor is executed synchronously when promise object is initialized with \"new\" keyword.\n// Console will print \"Hello\" when this code below is run\nlet alwaysWork = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  resolve();\n});\n\n// resolve() and reject() functions are the argument passed to .then() or .catch()\nalwaysWork.then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Explanations:</p> <ul> <li><code>function (resolve, reject) { console.log(\"Hello\"); resolve();</code> is the executor.</li> <li>We can think of <code>Promise</code> in JS as this way: \"I want to run a piece of code (everything defined inside executor, synchronously). At the end of the code execution, I will either reach a success or failed state. If success, I would like to execute the <code>resolve()</code> function, otherwise I will execute <code>reject()</code>. I don't know yet what is the <code>resolve()</code> function. It will be provided when a function is passed as an argument to <code>.then()</code>. Same thing for <code>reject()</code>, which depends on function passed to <code>.catch()</code>\".</li> <li>In the example above, we use the anonymous function for <code>resolve()</code>, which is <code>() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\")</code>. This function is queued into microtask.</li> <li>However, it is logical that <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> can be a code that queues task to macrotask (e.g. you can have <code>setTimeout()</code> inside the function argument for <code>.then()</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider a more complicated example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(++count);\n  });\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter.then(incr).then(incr).then(incr);\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>In the above we instantiate an asynchronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable <code>count</code> and return a promise object that immediately <code>resolve</code> with the variable.</li> <li>Do you notice that we use closure here?</li> <li>Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the argument of <code>.then</code>. In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the new promise while incrementing <code>count</code> by 1.</li> <li>Fun-but-important fact: you can simply write the return statement of <code>incr()</code> function as <code>return ++count;</code>. JavaScript intrisically turn the returned value as a promise object resolved with returned value. We use this approach sometimes in the notes.</li> </ul> <p>When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes so that the we will stop incrementing the counter when a limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr()</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (count &gt; 1) {\n      reject(\"limit reached\");\n    } else {\n      resolve(++count);\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call.</p> <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n</code></pre> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>You might argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here.</p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function and creating a second counter.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(id) {\n  return function (count) {\n    console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      if (count &gt; 1) {\n        reject(\"limit reached\");\n      } else {\n        resolve(++count);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter1 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter1\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nlet counter2 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter2\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\nconsole.log(\"main done!\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle. Note that <code>nextTick()</code> queue the callback to macrotask. When executing the above example, we observe</p> <pre><code>main done!\nc1:0\nc2:0\nc1:1\nc2:1\nc1:2\nc2:2\nrejected: limit reached.\nrejected: limit reached.\ntick!\n</code></pre> <p>It reveals that the execution of the <code>incr</code> method calls for both promise objects are interleaved. The <code>tick</code> message shows that all these happens in one single event loop cycle because all the microtask from <code>promise</code> are executed before dequeueing macro task from the <code>nextTick()</code>. We will discuss what happen behind the scene in the next section.</p>"},{"location":"%0D/l4_2_nodejs/#nodejs-run-time-model","title":"Node.js run-time model","text":""},{"location":"%0D/l4_2_nodejs/#browser-vs-nodejs-runtime-revisit","title":"Browser vs NodeJS runtime (revisit)","text":"<p>Recall from the previous class, we studied the JavaScript run-time in the browser, which has a call stack, a heap, an event registry and a callback queue.</p> <ol> <li>The run-time executes the JavaScript main program in the call stack until no more stack frame left, and goes into the event loop.</li> <li>When there is an event triggered, the callback function associated with the event (in the event registery) will be added to the callback queue.</li> <li>In an event loop cycle, when there is no more frame in the call stack but there is some item in the call back queue, the run-time will dequeue the callback from the queue and add it to the call stack.</li> </ol> <p>In node.js runtime model, there are two callback queues:</p> <ol> <li>The macro task queue, which is same as the callback queue that stores callback associated with events.</li> <li>The micro task queue, which stores callbacks associated with promises.</li> </ol> <p>Given that promises are special builtin of node.js run-time, they are treated \"differently\" when executed.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code>. Open <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</code> in a browser. It will display the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically. With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"%0D/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

In this case, we expect that the route handler will return a list of objects containing <code>title</code> and <code>messages</code> attributes. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into a sequence of list items <code>li</code>.

We define  * a <code>get_bal()</code> promise builder function which returns a promise that resolves on the account's balance. * a <code>set_bal()</code> promise builder function which returns a promise that updates the account's balance.</p> <p>Next we define a <code>transfer()</code> function which transfer some amount from two accounts, by calling <code>get_bal()</code> and <code>set_bal()</code> <pre><code>async function transfer(src, dst, amt) {\n    let src_bal = await get_bal(src);\n    let dst_bal = await get_bal(dst);\n    if (src_bal &gt; amt) {\n        await set_bal(dst, dst_bal + amt); \n        await set_bal(src, src_bal - amt);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Finally, we define our main function and the aftermath observation  <pre><code>async function main() {\n    await transfer(b, a, 100);\n    await transfer(c, a, 50);\n}\n\nmain().then(\n    async function () {\n        let bal_b = await get_bal(b);\n        let bal_a = await get_bal(a);\n        let bal_c = await get_bal(c);\n        console.log(bal_a,bal_b,bal_c);\n    }\n)\n</code></pre> In the <code>main()</code> function, we sequentially transfer 100 from <code>b</code> to <code>a</code> then transfer 50 from <code>c</code> to <code>a</code>. </p> <p>We observe the closing balances as <code>250 100 100</code>.</p> <p>This is fine because the two transfer operations were carried out in sequence, (enforced by two <code>await</code>).</p> <p>Suppose we change the <code>main</code> function as follows, </p> <pre><code>async function main() {\n    transfer(b, a, 100);\n    await transfer(c, a, 50);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>or </p> <p><pre><code>async function main() {\n    await Promise.all([\n        transfer(b, a, 100),\n        transfer(c, a, 50)\n    ]);\n}\n</code></pre> In either way, the two transfer operations are performed concurrently, i.e. the promises are now interleaved. When we observe the closing balances as <code>150 100 100</code>. A racing condition is triggered.</p> <p>One may argue that the above variants of <code>main()</code> are unusual, after some code review, we perhaps can eliminate the bugs. However, in the event that the two transfer operations are triggered from separate server events, e.g. from two different HTTP request handlers, such a racing condition is inevitable.</p>"},{"location":"_/l12_2_code_std/#concurrency-control-at-the-database-level","title":"Concurrency Control at the database level","text":"<p>We can address such a data racing condition at the database level.

The following diagram shows the call stack with three frames when the program execution point is right before <code>return z*2</code>.</p> <p><pre><code>graph LR;\n    id1(\"g(11)\")\n    id2(\"f(10)&lt;br/&gt;y=11\")\n    id3(main)</code></pre> As <code>g(11)</code> call returns we remove the top most frame, i.e. <code>g(11)</code>, then back to the frame <code>f(10)</code>.  <pre><code>graph LR;\n    id2(\"f(10)&lt;br/&gt;y=11\")\n    id3(main)</code></pre> We return <code>22</code> as result and remove the second frame, <code>f(10)</code>.  <pre><code>graph LR;\n    id3(main)</code></pre> Lastly, we remove the <code>main</code> frame as we reach to the end of the program.</p> <p>Things become more interesting in the presence of call-back functions associated with some UI elements.  Recall one of our earlier examples, <pre><code>function handleButton1Click() {\n    var textbox1 = document.getElementById(\"textbox1\");\n    var span1 = document.getElementById(\"span1\");\n    span1.innerHTML = textbox1.value;\n}\nfunction run() {\n    var button1 = document.getElementById(\"button1\");\n    button1.addEventListener(\"click\", handleButton1Click); \n}\ndocument.addEventListener( \"DOMContentLoaded\", run);\n</code></pre> The program contains three portions, the two function definitions and a statement. JavaScript run-time in the browser executes them sequentially and synchronously, in the <code>main</code> call frame. To illustrate the step by step program execution let's consider the following table. The first column is the program counter. The second column captures the call stack, for simplicity, we use python's style list to represent a stack, where the left most element the bottom frame. The third column is a mapping from (UI) events to call-back functions, we use Python's style dictionary syntax. The fourth coulumn is the callback queue (again we use python's list style)</p> program counter (line num) call stack event reg table callback queue 1 [main] {} [] 6 [main] {} [] 10 [main] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code> : <code>run</code>} [] <p>The run-time first execute the function declaration in line 1, in call frame <code>main</code>, which does not affect the event registeration table nor the callback queue. Similar observation applies when it move on to execute the function declaration in line 6. When the program counter is at line 10, we are add the last statement of the main program. Add an event listener to the even <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>, which creates an entry to the even registration table, mapping <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> to the function <code>run</code> as callback. After line 10, the call stack becomes empty as <code>main</code> ended. However the JavaScript run-time for rendering this web page is still running. It is executing an event-loop, in which it periodically check whether there is anything is the callback queue. At this point in time the browser continues to render the HTML page. When the HTML document is fully rendered, the browser triggers an <code>DomContentLoaded</code> event. At this point the callback function <code>run</code> associated with the event is enqueued to the callback queue.  Since the call stack is empty and the callback queue is not, the JavaScript run-time dequeues <code>run</code> from the callback queue and creates a call frame in the call stack. It continues to move the program counter from lines 7-9.</p> program counter (line num) call stack event reg table callback queue ... ... ... ... [] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>} [<code>run</code>] 7 [<code>run</code>] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>} [] 8 [<code>run</code>] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>} [] 9 [<code>run</code>] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>, <code>button1.click</code> : <code>handleButton1Click</code> } [] <p>At the end of line 9, a new event (<code>button1</code> being clicked) is being registered, mapping to <code>handleButton1Click</code>. The call stack becomes empty again. The JavaScript run-time goes into the event loop again, waiting for next event to take place. </p> <p>When someone clicks on the button <code>button1</code>, the callback function <code>handleButton1Click</code> will be enqeued into the callback queue. The run-time will \"move\" it into the call stack to execute it.</p>"},{"location":"_/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#we-have-purposely-ignored-something","title":"We have purposely ignored something ...","text":"<p>Actually, besides the callback, there are something called promises which enable JavaScript code to support asynchronous programming.

(We don't need to import it when the code is executed in the browser as all browser has <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class builtin in the run-time, but this is not the case for node.js). In the second statement, we instantiate an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object.  In the third line, we read the command line arguments into a variable <code>args</code>. The following <code>if-else</code> statement check whether the user supplies enough arguments.  In the then branch, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.  Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the state of the request changing. As we discussed earlier,  the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the callstack for execution.  In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is  done, we extract the response text and print it out. After setting up the callback function, we open the request and submit it.</p> <p>If we execute this script, we will observe the API request's repsonse being printed on the command line.</p> <p>Next let's consider another example that interacts with file system via the <code>node:fs</code> library (which is builtin). <pre><code>import { writeFile } from 'node:fs';\nconst txt = \"hello\";\nwriteFile('save.txt', txt, (err) =&gt; {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('The file has been saved!');\n}); \n</code></pre> In the second statement,we define the text data to be written to the file.

This function argument is called the executor. An executor function is a higher order function that takes two functions as arguments, commonly named as <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. <code>resolve</code> is applied to the result of the promise during normal execution, <code>reject</code> is applied when some error occurs, (cf. <code>throw</code>). In the following we instantiate a <code>Promise</code> object that always resolves.</p> <pre><code>let alwaysWork = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  resolve();\n})\n</code></pre> <p>Let's consider a more interesting example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter()  {\n    var count = 0;\n    return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        resolve(count);\n    });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n    console.log(count);\n    return ++count;\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n</code></pre> <p>In the above we instantiate an asychronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable and return a promise object that  resolves with the variable, recall that <code>resolve</code> is the continuation (i.e. the next  step of the promise). Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the parameter of <code>.then</code>.  In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the result of incrementing <code>count</code> by 1. One may point out that <code>incr</code> does not return a new Promise object, how could this work? Behind the scene, node.js rewrite the <code>incr</code> function as </p> <p><pre><code>function incr(count) {\n    console.log(count);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; resolve(++count));\n}\n</code></pre> When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2 \n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes to the example, so that the <code>incr</code> function will stop incrementing the counter when the limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n    console.log(count);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        if (count &gt; 1) {\n            reject(\"limit reached\");\n        } else {\n            resolve(++count);\n        }\n    }); \n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call. <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .catch( (reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`))\n</code></pre></p> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2 \nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>We now argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here. </p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function  and creating a second counter. </p> <p><pre><code>1: function asyncCounter()  {\n2:     var count = 0;\n3:     return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n4:         resolve(count);\n5:     });\n6: }\n7:\n8: function incr(id) {\n9:     return function (count) {\n10:        console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n11:        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n12:            if (count &gt; 1) {\n13:                reject(\"limit reached\");\n14:            } else {\n15:                resolve(++count);\n16:            }\n17:        }); \n18:    };\n19:}\n20:\n21:let counter1 = asyncCounter();\n22:\n23:counter1\n24:    .then( incr(\"c1\") )\n25:    .then( incr(\"c1\") )\n26:    .then( incr(\"c1\") )\n27:    .catch( (reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`))\n28: \n29:let counter2 = asyncCounter();\n30:\n31:counter2\n32:    .then( incr(\"c2\") )\n33:    .then( incr(\"c2\") )\n34:    .then( incr(\"c2\") )\n35:    .catch( (reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`))\n36:\n37:process.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\n38:console.log(\"main done!\")\n</code></pre> In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle.

The run-time executes the JavaScript main program in the call stack until no more stack frame left, and goes into the event loop.  2. When there is an event triggered, the callback function associated with the event (in the event registery) will be added to the callback queue.  3. In an event loop cycle, when there is no more frame in the call stack but there is some item in the call back queue, the run-time will dequeue the  callback from the queue and add it to the call stack. </p> <p>With the presence of <code>Promise</code>, there are more than one callback queues.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise. </p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require('http');\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req,res) =&gt; {\n  if(req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n  else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n})\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code> without a need to step an npm project structure. Open  <pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/\n</code></pre> in a browser will dipslay the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by registering its executor with the HTTP request event. </p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some  common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically.  With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"_/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require('express')\nconst app = express()\nconst port = 3000\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send('Hello World!')\n})\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)\n})\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

A HTML form capture the inputs from its child elements and converts into a form, where each input value is assocated with a name. Thus in the input text element, we added a name attribute <code>message</code>. For the button, we changed its type from <code>button</code> to <code>submit</code> to indicate that when  this button is clicked the form should be submitted. The <code>action</code> attribute of the form element indicate the destination of the end point, the method is HTTP POST. Below the form, we have an HTML order list element <code>ol</code>, whose content will be generated via the embedded javscript template language. In this case, we expect that the  route handler will return an object containing a <code>title</code> and a <code>messages</code> list. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into  a sequence of list items <code>li</code>. Within each <code>li</code> element, we render the message's time and text.</p> <p>Next we update the <code>routes/echo.js</code> as follows <pre><code>const express = require('express'); // existing\nconst model = require('../models/message.js'); // existing\nvar router = express.Router(); // existing\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\nrouter.get('/:msg', async function(req, res, next) { // existing\n    const msg = req.params.msg;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nrouter.get('/', async function(req, res, next) { // updated\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\",'messages': messages});\n});\n\nrouter.post('/submit', async function(req, res, next) { // new\n    const msg = req.body.message;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\", 'messages': messages});\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router; // existing\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the second routing rule, we listen to the local URL path <code>/echo/</code>, and retrieve all the messags, and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template. This is to handle  user accessing  <pre><code>http://localhost:3000/echo\n</code></pre> In the third routing rule, we liste ot the local URL path <code>/echo/submit</code> over HTTP POST, we retrieve the message (via element name attribute = \"message\"), create a new message, retrieve all the messages from the model and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template.</p> <p>Being different from HTTP GET, parameters of the requests submited via HTTP POST are packaged into the body of the request instead of being exposed as part of the URL.  Technically speaking, users can't access a HTTP POST endpoint directly via the browser URL links or navigation bar. </p> <p>To allow the form data embeded in the HTTP POST request to be parsed, we add the following to the <code>app.js</code></p> <pre><code>const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); // new \napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // new\n\napp.use('/', indexRouter); // existing\napp.use('/users', usersRouter) // existing\n</code></pre> <p></p>"},{"location":"_/l6_1_expressjs_frontend/#approach-2-using-ajax","title":"Approach 2 Using AJAX","text":"<p>The advantage of Approach 1 is that it is relatively simple to implement and codes are pretty structured. One issue with Approach 1 is that the page <code>echoform</code> is reloaded each time we submit a new message.  This is not a big deal when the page is simple with little content. It affects the user experience as the content of the page get complex and a single click would cause the entire page to refresh. </p> <p>To address this issue, we could use AJAX.  The idea of AJAX is to divide the view template HTML into sub regions, when a user input is detected, we use the client side javascript to update the affected sub region. </p> <p>We re-start from the point of <code>echo.ejs</code> template again.

Element without child/content can be written in a short form, e.g. <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;</code> is a short hand of <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;</code>.

The fourth coulumn is the callback queue (again we use python's list style)</p> line num call stack event reg table callback queue 1 [main] {} [] 6 [main] {} [] 10 [main] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code> : <code>run</code>} [] <p>The run-time first execute the function declaration in line 1, in call frame <code>main</code>, which does not affect the event registration table nor the callback queue. Similar observation applies when it move on to execute the function declaration in line 6. When the program counter is at line 10, we are add the last statement of the main program. Add an event listener to the even <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>, which creates an entry to the even registration table, mapping <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> to the function <code>run</code> as callback. After line 10, the call stack becomes empty as <code>main</code> ended. However the JavaScript run-time for rendering this web page is still running. It is executing an event-loop, in which it periodically check whether there is anything is the callback queue. At this point in time the browser continues to render the HTML page. When the HTML document is fully rendered, the browser triggers an <code>DomContentLoaded</code> event. At this point the callback function <code>run</code> associated with the event is enqueued to the callback queue. Since the call stack is empty and the callback queue is not, the JavaScript run-time dequeues <code>run</code> from the callback queue and creates a call frame in the call stack. It continues to move the program counter from lines 7-9.</p> program counter (line num) call stack event reg table callback queue ... ... ... ...

(We don't need to import it when the code is executed in the browser as all browser has <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class builtin in the run-time, but this is not the case for node.js).</li> <li>In the second statement, we instantiate an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object.</li> <li>In the third line, we read the command line arguments into a variable <code>args</code>. Remember that we can pass the argument when executing the file. For example, if the filename is <code>index.js</code>, then we can execute <code>node index.js abcd</code> in the terminal. In this example, <code>abcd</code> is the command line argument.</li> <li>The following <code>if-else</code> statement checks whether the user supplies an argument. The <code>node</code> and <code>index.js</code> are counted, so the length must be 3.</li> <li>In the <code>if</code> body, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.</li> <li>Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the HTTP Request state is changed. As we discussed earlier, the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the call stack for execution. Read about <code>.onreadystatechange</code> here and <code>readyState</code> property here. Basically, HTTP request has several states, and the last state is state 4 (DONE) which means that the data transfer has been completed (response received) or failed.</li> <li>In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is done, we extract the response text and print it out.</li> <li> <p>After setting up the callback function, we <code>open</code> the request and submit it. In this example, we send a request to postman-echo which allows us to test sending a request as a client.

This function argument is called the executor. An executor function is a higher order function that takes two functions as arguments, commonly named as <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. <code>resolve</code> is applied to the result of the promise during normal execution, <code>reject</code> is applied when some error occurs. The function body of executor is executed synchronously while <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> are asynchronous and queued into microtask. Look at the simple <code>Promise</code> example below which is not using <code>reject</code>, but only <code>resolve</code>.</p> <pre><code>// executor is executed synchronously when promise object is initialized with \"new\" keyword.\n// Console will print \"Hello\" when this code below is run\nlet alwaysWork = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  resolve();\n});\n\n// resolve() and reject() functions are the argument passed to .then() or .catch()\nalwaysWork.then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Explanations:</p> <ul> <li><code>function (resolve, reject) { console.log(\"Hello\"); resolve();</code> is the executor.</li> <li>We can think of <code>Promise</code> in JS as this way: \"I want to run a piece of code (everything defined inside executor, synchronously). At the end of the code execution, I will either reach a success or failed state. If success, I would like to execute the <code>resolve()</code> function, otherwise I will execute <code>reject()</code>. I don't know yet what is the <code>resolve()</code> function. It will be provided when a function is passed as an argument to <code>.then()</code>. Same thing for <code>reject()</code>, which depends on function passed to <code>.catch()</code>\".</li> <li>In the example above, we use the anonymous function for <code>resolve()</code>, which is <code>() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\")</code>. This function is queued into microtask.</li> <li>However, it is logical that <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> can be a code that queues task to macrotask (e.g. you can have <code>setTimeout()</code> inside the function argument for <code>.then()</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider a more complicated example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(++count);\n  });\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter.then(incr).then(incr).then(incr);\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>In the above we instantiate an asynchronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable <code>count</code> and return a promise object that immediately <code>resolve</code> with the variable.</li> <li>Do you notice that we use closure here?</li> <li>Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the argument of <code>.then</code>. In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the new promise while incrementing <code>count</code> by 1.</li> <li>Fun-but-important fact: you can simply write the return statement of <code>incr()</code> function as <code>return ++count;</code>. JavaScript intrisically turn the returned value as a promise object resolved with returned value. We use this approach sometimes in the notes.</li> </ul> <p>When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes so that the we will stop incrementing the counter when a limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr()</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (count &gt; 1) {\n      reject(\"limit reached\");\n    } else {\n      resolve(++count);\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call.</p> <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n</code></pre> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>You might argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here.</p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function and creating a second counter.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(id) {\n  return function (count) {\n    console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      if (count &gt; 1) {\n        reject(\"limit reached\");\n      } else {\n        resolve(++count);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter1 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter1\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nlet counter2 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter2\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\nconsole.log(\"main done!\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle. Note that <code>nextTick()</code> queue the callback to macrotask. When executing the above example, we observe</p> <pre><code>main done!\nc1:0\nc2:0\nc1:1\nc2:1\nc1:2\nc2:2\nrejected: limit reached.\nrejected: limit reached.\ntick!\n</code></pre> <p>It reveals that the execution of the <code>incr</code> method calls for both promise objects are interleaved. The <code>tick</code> message shows that all these happens in one single event loop cycle because all the microtask from <code>promise</code> are executed before dequeueing macro task from the <code>nextTick()</code>.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise. </p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require('http');\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req,res) =&gt; {\n  if(req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n  else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n})\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code> without a need to step an npm project structure. Open  <pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/\n</code></pre> in a browser will dipslay the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by registering its executor with the HTTP request event. </p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some  common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically.  With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"_/notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require('express')\nconst app = express()\nconst port = 3000\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send('Hello World!')\n})\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)\n})\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

A connection pool allows us to regular the resource usage for database operations. </p> <p>The rest are similar to the one we learned using mongodb.</p> <p>Next in the same folder (<code>models</code>), create a file named <code>message.js</code> with the following content. </p> <p><pre><code>const db = require('./db.js');\n\nconst tableName = 'message';\n\nclass Message {\n    constructor(msg, time) {\n        this.msg = msg;\n        this.time = time;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function sync() {\n    try {\n        db.pool.query(`\n        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${tableName} (\n            msg VARCHAR(255),\n            time DATETIME PRIMARY KEY\n        )\n        `);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"database connection failed. \" + error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function all() {\n    try {\n\n        const [rows, fieldDefs] = await db.pool.query(`\n            SELECT msg, time FROM ${tableName}\n        `);\n        var list = [];\n        for (let row of rows) {\n            let message = new Message(row.msg, row.time);\n            list.push(message);\n        }\n        return list;\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"database connection failed. \" + error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function insertOne(message) {\n    try {\n\n        const [rows, fieldDefs] = await db.pool.query(`\n            INSERT INTO ${tableName} (msg, time) VALUES (?, ?)\n        `, [message.msg, message.time]);\n\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"database connection failed. \" + error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function insertMany(messages) {\n    for (let message of messages) {\n        await insertOne(message);\n    }\n}\n\n\nmodule.exports =  { Message, all, sync, insertOne, insertMany }\n</code></pre> Similar to how <code>my_mongo_app</code>, we define a class <code>Message</code> to model each message received and saved. MySQL data must be stored in a table with schema definition. We define a <code>sync</code> function which creates the table in the database if it is not there. This function will be called in the <code>app.js</code> when the web app starts. We provide a set of functions. </p> <ul> <li>Function <code>all</code> retrieves all the messages from the table.</li> <li>Function <code>insertOne</code> inserts a message using the INSERT statement. In this case we find two <code>?</code>s in the statement, these two question marks are the placeholders for the verified values. In this case <code>message.msg</code> and <code>message.time</code> will be subsituted in the statement if they are valid. The <code>mysql2</code> library will verify that the values substituting <code>?</code> do not contain illegal characters which might cause some security issues, (which will be discussed in some class later).</li> <li>Function <code>insertMany</code> inserts a list of messages.</li> </ul> <p>Next we create a <code>routes/echo.js</code> file with the following content, </p> <p><pre><code>const express = require('express');\nconst model = require('../models/message.js');\nvar router = express.Router();\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\n\nrouter.get('/:msg', async function(req, res, next) {\n    const msg = req.params.msg;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre> which is similar to what we have seen in the <code>my_mongo_app</code>.</p> <p>Finally, in the <code>app.js</code> file, we include the following </p> <pre><code>var logger = require('morgan');\n// adding the following\nconst db = require('./models/db.js');\nconst process = require('process');\n\nprocess.on('SIGINT', db.cleanup);\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', db.cleanup);\nconst message = require('./models/message.js');\nmessage.sync();\n// end\n</code></pre> <p>We imported the <code>db.js</code> file we created and <code>process</code> library so that we can register the <code>db.cleanup</code> function as the callback when the web app terminates.

A HTML form capture the inputs from its child elements and converts into a form, where each input value is assocated with a name. Thus in the input text element, we added a name attribute <code>message</code>. For the button, we changed its type from <code>button</code> to <code>submit</code> to indicate that when  this button is clicked the form should be submitted. The <code>action</code> attribute of the form element indicate the destination of the end point, the method is HTTP POST. Below the form, we have an HTML order list element <code>ol</code>, whose content will be generated via the embedded javscript template language. In this case, we expect that the  route handler will return an object containing a <code>title</code> and a <code>messages</code> list. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into  a sequence of list items <code>li</code>. Within each <code>li</code> element, we render the message's time and text.</p> <p>Next we update the <code>routes/echo.js</code> as follows <pre><code>const express = require('express'); // existing\nconst model = require('../models/message.js'); // existing\nvar router = express.Router(); // existing\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\nrouter.get('/:msg', async function(req, res, next) { // existing\n    const msg = req.params.msg;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nrouter.get('/', async function(req, res, next) { // updated\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\",'messages': messages});\n});\n\nrouter.post('/submit', async function(req, res, next) { // new\n    const msg = req.body.message;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\", 'messages': messages});\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router; // existing\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the second routing rule, we listen to the local URL path <code>/echo/</code>, and retrieve all the messags, and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template. This is to handle  user accessing  <pre><code>http://localhost:3000/echo\n</code></pre> In the third routing rule, we liste ot the local URL path <code>/echo/submit</code> over HTTP POST, we retrieve the message (via element name attribute = \"message\"), create a new message, retrieve all the messages from the model and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template.</p> <p>Being different from HTTP GET, parameters of the requests submited via HTTP POST are packaged into the body of the request instead of being exposed as part of the URL.  Technically speaking, users can't access a HTTP POST endpoint directly via the browser URL links or navigation bar. </p> <p>To allow the form data embeded in the HTTP POST request to be parsed, we add the following to the <code>app.js</code></p> <pre><code>const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); // new \napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // new\n\napp.use('/', indexRouter); // existing\napp.use('/users', usersRouter) // existing\n</code></pre> <p></p>"},{"location":"_/notes/l6_1_expressjs_frontend/#approach-2-using-ajax","title":"Approach 2 Using AJAX","text":"<p>The advantage of Approach 1 is that it is relatively simple to implement and codes are pretty structured.

It affects the user experience as the content of the page get complex and a single click would cause the entire page to refresh. </p> <p>To address this issue, we could use AJAX.  The idea of AJAX is to divide the view template HTML into sub regions, when a user input is detected, we use the client side javascript to update the affected sub region. </p> <p>We re-start from the point of <code>echo.ejs</code> template again.

The <code>screen</code> object allows us to make reference to the screen rendered in the test environment.  The <code>getByText()</code> method takes a regex pattern which search for the text \"submit\" in upper or lower cases. The result is stored in the variable <code>button</code>. Finally we assert that the button can be found in the rendered document.  We argue that the above test case is leaning towards the visual test category. </p> <p>We recall another component used in the <code>Echo</code> app, <code>MessageList</code>. </p> <pre><code>function MessageList({messages}) {\n    let rows = [];\n    for (let i in messages) {\n        rows.push(\n            &lt;tr key={messages[i].time}\n                data-testid={messages[i].time}&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;{messages[i].time}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{messages[i].msg}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n        );\n    }\n    return (\n        &lt;table data-testid=\"message-list\"&gt;\n            &lt;tbody&gt;\n                &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Message&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n                {rows}\n            &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        &lt;/table&gt;\n    )\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For the ease of reference, we give some test ids to the data rows and the table.  We now can derive the following case.  <pre><code>test('No message is rendered in empty MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgs = [];\n    render(&lt;MessageList messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(table.firstElementChild.children.length == 1); // only contains the header row.\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the above test case, we render a <code>MessageList</code> component with an empty message list.  We expect the table's <code>tbody</code> element should contains only one row, which is the the header row.</p> <p>In the next test case, we instantiate a <code>MessageList</code> component with a singleton message list and expect that the  table should contains the message. <pre><code>test('A message is rendered in a singleton MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"hello\";\n    const msgTime = (new Date()).toString();\n    const msg = { time : msgTime, msg: msgTxt };\n    const msgs = [msg];\n    render(&lt;MessageList \n            messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n    expect(table.contains(row));\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that both of the test cases are functional tests.</p> <p>Finally let's consider testing the <code>Echo</code> component. Recall that,</p> <pre><code>function Echo({http_addr}) {\n    const [msgTxt, setMsgTxt] = useState(\"\");\n    function handleSubmitClick() {\n        submitNewMessage();    \n    }\n    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n    async function submitNewMessage() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/submit`,\n        {\n            method: 'POST',\n            body: `msg=${msgTxt}`,\n            headers: {\n                'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n            }              \n        });\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n\n    async function initMessages() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/all`);\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n    useEffect( () =&gt; {\n        initMessages();\n    }, []);\n\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;NewMessageBar message={msgTxt} onMessageChange={setMsgTxt} onSubmitClick={handleSubmitClick}/&gt;\n            &lt;MessageList messages={messages}/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code snippet, we abstract the backend API URL via the <code>http_url</code> variable, for ease of mocking the API host.</p> <p>We define two test cases of the <code>Echo</code> component in the <code>Echo.test.js</code> test file as follows.</p> <pre><code>import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport './jest.polyfills'\nimport {http, HttpResponse} from 'msw'; \nimport {setupServer} from 'msw/node';\nimport Echo from './Echo';\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n    http.get('/echo/all', () =&gt; {\n      return HttpResponse.json(\n        [{'msg':'hello','time':'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'}])\n    }),\n    http.post('/echo/submit', () =&gt; {\n        return HttpResponse.json(\n          [{msg:'hello',time:'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'},\n           {msg:'bye', time:'2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z'}\n          ])\n      }),\n    )\n\nbeforeAll(() =&gt; server.listen())\nafterEach(() =&gt; server.resetHandlers())\nafterAll(() =&gt; server.close())\n\n\ntest('testing initMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n\n});\n\ntest('testing submitNewMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"bye\";\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    const textbox = screen.getByLabelText('echo-message');\n    const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);\n    fireEvent.change(textbox, {target: {value: msgTxt}});\n    await userEvent.click(submitButton);\n    expect(textbox.value).toBe(msgTxt);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n})\n</code></pre> <p>As we want to isolate the test from the backend API, we need to mock the API calls. This is achieved by using the library <code>msw</code>. </p> <p>Due to some API deprecation, to import <code>msw</code> with versions of Jest and React we are currently using we need to introduce some extra configuration for Jest in <code>jest.polyfills</code>. For details setup, please refer to this file.</p> <p><code>setupServer()</code> functions allows us to define a mock backend API server with the required endpoints.  The first test case <code>'testing initMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the first rendering of the <code>Echo()</code> component.  We want to ensure that the table contains a row with the message returned by the mocked API <code>/echo/all</code>.  The second test case <code>'testing submitNewMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the user action of entering the message \"bye\" in the textbox and clicking the submit button.

We only consider HTML5 in this unit. An HTML document consists of a doctype declaration, which tells the browser which version of HTML it is in. The second part is an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>Each element consists of an open tag and a close tag and the children. For instance, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the opening tag and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> is the closing. The children of an elemnent can be elements or texts. However there are a set of rules governing what contents could appear in a given element. In the above example, the content of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element consists of a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. Element without child/content can be written in a short form, e.g. <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;</code> is a short hand of <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;</code>. Note that <code>charset=\"utf-8\"</code> denotes an attribute of this <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>The HTML document in the above example defines a structure as follows,</p> <ul> <li>html</li> <li>head<ul> <li>meta</li> <li>title</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> <li>body<ul> <li>paragraph</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#css","title":"CSS","text":"<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a language used in describing the presentation of a document. Being different from HTML, it focuses on the aesthetical requirement of the documents.

Each rule consists of two parts.</p> <ol> <li>terms preceding the <code>{</code> are called the selectors.</li> <li>terms being enclosed by <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are called the declarations.</li> <li>Each declaration consists of a property (preceding the colon <code>:</code>) and a value (following the colon <code>:</code>).</li> <li>Declarations are terminated by a semi colon <code>;</code>.</li> </ol> <p>For instance, in the first rule, we find <code>p</code> as the selector, which means that this rule is applicable to all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements in the target HTML document. For all applicable elements, we want to set the margin to be 10 pixel wide. The second rule applies to a particular element with id = <code>#msg1</code>. Note that ids in an HTML document must be unique. In this rule, we want to set the font family of the text contained in the applicable elements to <code>Courier New</code>. In the third rule, we would like to apply the declaration to all elements with <code>class</code> attribute equal to <code>heading</code>.</p> <p>Suppose the above css definitions are stored in a file named <code>hello.css</code>, we could add the following as one of the child element of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element in the earlier html document.</p> <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;50.003&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"hello.css\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"heading\"&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p id=\"msg1\" class=\"message\"&gt;It's about Software Engineering!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Note that selectors are composable, e.g. selector <code>p.heading</code> selects all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements with <code>class</code> equal to <code>heading</code>.</p> <p>For information refers to</p> <pre><code>https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"notes/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#overlapping-css-rules","title":"Overlapping CSS rules","text":"<p>Suppose we add a new CSS rule to the earlier CSS</p> <pre><code>p {\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n\n#msg1 {\n  font-family: \"Courier New\", Courier, monospace;\n}\n\n.heading {\n  font-size: larger;\n}\n// new rule\np.message {\n  margin: 5px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The first and the newly added rules are overlapping, i.e. the set of HTML elements they select are overlapping, i.e.</p> <pre><code>&lt;p id=\"msg1\" class=\"message\"&gt;It's about Software Engineering!&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>is selected by both rules.

Remember that we can pass the argument when executing the file. For example, if the filename is <code>index.js</code>, then we can execute <code>node index.js abcd</code> in the terminal. In this example, <code>abcd</code> is the command line argument.</li> <li>The following <code>if-else</code> statement checks whether the user supplies an argument. The <code>node</code> and <code>index.js</code> are counted, so the length must be 3.</li> <li>In the <code>if</code> body, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.</li> <li>Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the HTTP Request state is changed. As we discussed earlier, the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the call stack for execution. Read about <code>.onreadystatechange</code> here and <code>readyState</code> property here. Basically, HTTP request has several states, and the last state is state 4 (DONE) which means that the data transfer has been completed (response received) or failed.</li> <li>In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is done, we extract the response text and print it out.</li> <li> <p>After setting up the callback function, we <code>open</code> the request and submit it. In this example, we send a request to postman-echo which allows us to test sending a request as a client. The API will return a JSON response.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we execute this script, we will observe the API request's response being printed on the command line.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Next let's consider another example that interacts with file system via the <code>node:fs</code> library (which is a builtin module).</p> <pre><code>import { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\nconst txt = \"hello\";\nwriteFile(\"save.txt\", txt, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>At line 2, we define the text data to be written to the file.</li> <li>At line 3, we write the result to a file named <code>save.txt</code>, note that <code>writeFile()</code> takes three arguments.

This function argument is called the executor. An executor function is a higher order function that takes two functions as arguments, commonly named as <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. <code>resolve</code> is applied to the result of the promise during normal execution, <code>reject</code> is applied when some error occurs. The function body of executor is executed synchronously while <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> are asynchronous and queued into microtask. Look at the simple <code>Promise</code> example below which is not using <code>reject</code>, but only <code>resolve</code>.</p> <pre><code>// executor is executed synchronously when promise object is initialized with \"new\" keyword.\n// Console will print \"Hello\" when this code below is run\nlet alwaysWork = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  resolve();\n});\n\n// resolve() and reject() functions are the argument passed to .then() or .catch()\nalwaysWork.then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Explanations:</p> <ul> <li><code>function (resolve, reject) { console.log(\"Hello\"); resolve();</code> is the executor.</li> <li>We can think of <code>Promise</code> in JS as this way: \"I want to run a piece of code (everything defined inside executor, synchronously). At the end of the code execution, I will either reach a success or failed state. If success, I would like to execute the <code>resolve()</code> function, otherwise I will execute <code>reject()</code>. I don't know yet what is the <code>resolve()</code> function. It will be provided when a function is passed as an argument to <code>.then()</code>. Same thing for <code>reject()</code>, which depends on function passed to <code>.catch()</code>\".</li> <li>In the example above, we use the anonymous function for <code>resolve()</code>, which is <code>() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\")</code>. This function is queued into microtask.</li> <li>However, it is logical that <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> can be a code that queues task to macrotask (e.g. you can have <code>setTimeout()</code> inside the function argument for <code>.then()</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider a more complicated example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(++count);\n  });\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter.then(incr).then(incr).then(incr);\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>In the above we instantiate an asynchronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable <code>count</code> and return a promise object that immediately <code>resolve</code> with the variable.</li> <li>Do you notice that we use closure here?</li> <li>Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the argument of <code>.then</code>. In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the new promise while incrementing <code>count</code> by 1.</li> <li>Fun-but-important fact: you can simply write the return statement of <code>incr()</code> function as <code>return ++count;</code>. JavaScript intrisically turn the returned value as a promise object resolved with returned value. We use this approach sometimes in the notes.</li> </ul> <p>When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes so that the we will stop incrementing the counter when a limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr()</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (count &gt; 1) {\n      reject(\"limit reached\");\n    } else {\n      resolve(++count);\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call.</p> <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n</code></pre> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>You might argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here.</p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function and creating a second counter.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(id) {\n  return function (count) {\n    console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      if (count &gt; 1) {\n        reject(\"limit reached\");\n      } else {\n        resolve(++count);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter1 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter1\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nlet counter2 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter2\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\nconsole.log(\"main done!\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle. Note that <code>nextTick()</code> queue the callback to macrotask.

We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument.

One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically. With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

This phase is also known as logical modelling (and subsequently physical modelling).</p> <p>Let's consider the modelling the ER diagram with <code>Staff</code> and <code>Dept</code> and <code>Work</code> relationship (without the <code>Manage</code> relation).</p> <p>There are more than one possible logical models:</p> <p>Approach one: Storing <code>Dept</code> as a collection, which has attributes <code>code</code> and <code>staff</code>. <code>code</code> is a string, <code>staff</code> is a list of objects. Each object in <code>staff</code> is a document with <code>sid</code> and <code>name</code> as attributes. e.g.</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"code\": \"HR\",\n  \"staff\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"name\": \"aaron\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"name\": \"betty\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Approach two: Storing <code>staff</code> as a separate collection from <code>dept</code>. The <code>staff</code> attribute in the <code>dept</code> document should contains only the ids of the staff. A <code>dept</code> document</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"code\": \"HR\",\n  \"staff_ids\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A <code>staff</code> document contains <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>dept_code</code> attributes.</p> <pre><code> {\n   'id': 1,\n   'name': 'aaron'\n   'dept_code': 'HR'\n }\n</code></pre> <p>Both design will work. The advantage of the first approach is that all the information are now stored in one collection, it is easier to ensure the data consistency, while the downside is that as the conceptual model becomes complex, we might have documents with too many level of nesting. Approach two avoids the deep nesting of the document structure, however, to maintain the data consistency requires additional checking and validation in the application.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#cohort-exercises","title":"Cohort Exercises","text":"<p>Using MongoDB document example, can you give a logical design of the ER diagram with the <code>Staff</code> and <code>Dept</code> entities and <code>Work</code> and <code>Manage</code> relationships?</p> <p>Can you implement a web app with the correspondent end-point (routes) handlers to support</p> <ol> <li>add and update <code>staff</code></li> <li>add <code>dept</code></li> <li>find <code>staff</code>s by department code</li> <li>find <code>staff</code>s by staff id</li> </ol>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#some-special-cases-of-er-diagrams","title":"Some special cases of ER diagrams","text":"<p>There are some difficult cases of ER diagrams to be modeled in document database in general,</p> <p>For instance a ternery relationship below  For simplicity, we omitted the attributes of the entities.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code>. Open <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</code> in a browser. It will display the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically. With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

For the submit button, we can use <code>submit</code> type. The <code>action</code> attribute of the form element indicates the destination of the end point. Below the form, we have an HTML order list element <code>ol</code>, whose content will be generated via the embedded javscript template language. In this case, we expect that the route handler will return a list of objects containing <code>title</code> and <code>messages</code> attributes. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into a sequence of list items <code>li</code>. Within each <code>li</code> element, we render the message's time and text.</p> <p>Next we update the <code>routes/echo.js</code> as follows</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\"); // existing\nconst model = require(\"../models/message.js\"); // existing\nvar router = express.Router(); // existing\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\nrouter.get(\"/:msg\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // existing\n  const msg = req.params.msg;\n  const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n  await model.insertMany([message]);\n  const messages = await model.all();\n  console.log(messages);\n  res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nrouter.get(\"/\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // updated\n  const messages = await model.all();\n  res.render(`echoform`, { title: \"Echo App\", messages: messages });\n});\n\nrouter.post(\"/submit\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // new\n  const msg = req.body.message;\n  const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n  await model.insertMany([message]);\n  res.redirect(\"/echo\");\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router; // existing\n</code></pre> <p>In the second routing rule, we listen to the local URL path <code>/echo/</code>, and retrieve all the messages, and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template.

We expect the table's <code>tbody</code> element should contains only one row, which is the the header row.</p> <p>In the next test case, we instantiate a <code>MessageList</code> component with a singleton message list and expect that the  table should contains the message. <pre><code>test('A message is rendered in a singleton MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"hello\";\n    const msgTime = (new Date()).toString();\n    const msg = { time : msgTime, msg: msgTxt };\n    const msgs = [msg];\n    render(&lt;MessageList \n            messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n    expect(table.contains(row));\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that both of the test cases are functional tests.</p> <p>Finally let's consider testing the <code>Echo</code> component. Recall that,</p> <pre><code>function Echo({http_addr}) {\n    const [msgTxt, setMsgTxt] = useState(\"\");\n    function handleSubmitClick() {\n        submitNewMessage();    \n    }\n    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n    async function submitNewMessage() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/submit`,\n        {\n            method: 'POST',\n            body: `msg=${msgTxt}`,\n            headers: {\n                'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n            }              \n        });\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n\n    async function initMessages() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/all`);\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n    useEffect( () =&gt; {\n        initMessages();\n    }, []);\n\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;NewMessageBar message={msgTxt} onMessageChange={setMsgTxt} onSubmitClick={handleSubmitClick}/&gt;\n            &lt;MessageList messages={messages}/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code snippet, we abstract the backend API URL via the <code>http_url</code> variable, for ease of mocking the API host.</p> <p>We define two test cases of the <code>Echo</code> component in the <code>Echo.test.js</code> test file as follows.</p> <pre><code>import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport './jest.polyfills'\nimport {http, HttpResponse} from 'msw'; \nimport {setupServer} from 'msw/node';\nimport Echo from './Echo';\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n    http.get('/echo/all', () =&gt; {\n      return HttpResponse.json(\n        [{'msg':'hello','time':'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'}])\n    }),\n    http.post('/echo/submit', () =&gt; {\n        return HttpResponse.json(\n          [{msg:'hello',time:'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'},\n           {msg:'bye', time:'2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z'}\n          ])\n      }),\n    )\n\nbeforeAll(() =&gt; server.listen())\nafterEach(() =&gt; server.resetHandlers())\nafterAll(() =&gt; server.close())\n\n\ntest('testing initMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n\n});\n\ntest('testing submitNewMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"bye\";\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    const textbox = screen.getByLabelText('echo-message');\n    const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);\n    fireEvent.change(textbox, {target: {value: msgTxt}});\n    await userEvent.click(submitButton);\n    expect(textbox.value).toBe(msgTxt);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n})\n</code></pre> <p>As we want to isolate the test from the backend API, we need to mock the API calls. This is achieved by using the library <code>msw</code>. </p> <p>Due to some API deprecation, to import <code>msw</code> with versions of Jest and React we are currently using we need to introduce some extra configuration for Jest in <code>jest.polyfills</code>.

The first test case <code>'testing initMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the first rendering of the <code>Echo()</code> component.  We want to ensure that the table contains a row with the message returned by the mocked API <code>/echo/all</code>.  The second test case <code>'testing submitNewMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the user action of entering the message \"bye\" in the textbox and clicking the submit button.

For instance, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the opening tag and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> is the closing. The children of an elemnent can be elements or texts. However there are a set of rules governing what contents could appear in a given element. In the above example, the content of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element consists of a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. Element without child/content can be written in a short form, e.g. <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;</code> is a short hand of <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;</code>. Note that <code>charset=\"utf-8\"</code> denotes an attribute of this <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>The HTML document in the above example defines a structure as follows,</p> <ul> <li>html</li> <li>head<ul> <li>meta</li> <li>title</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> <li>body<ul> <li>paragraph</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"%0D/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#css","title":"CSS","text":"<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a language used in describing the presentation of a document.

For all applicable elements, we want to set the margin to be 10 pixel wide. The second rule applies to a particular element with id = <code>#msg1</code>. Note that ids in an HTML document must be unique. In this rule, we want to set the font family of the text contained in the applicable elements to <code>Courier New</code>.

(We don't need to import it when the code is executed in the browser as all browser has <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class builtin in the run-time, but this is not the case for node.js).</li> <li>In the second statement, we instantiate an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object.</li> <li>In the third line, we read the command line arguments into a variable <code>args</code>. Remember that we can pass the argument when executing the file. For example, if the filename is <code>index.js</code>, then we can execute <code>node index.js abcd</code> in the terminal. In this example, <code>abcd</code> is the command line argument.</li> <li>The following <code>if-else</code> statement checks whether the user supplies an argument. The <code>node</code> and <code>index.js</code> are counted, so the length must be 3.</li> <li>In the <code>if</code> body, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.</li> <li>Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the HTTP Request state is changed. As we discussed earlier, the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the call stack for execution. Read about <code>.onreadystatechange</code> here and <code>readyState</code> property here. Basically, HTTP request has several states, and the last state is state 4 (DONE) which means that the data transfer has been completed (response received) or failed.</li> <li>In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is done, we extract the response text and print it out.</li> <li> <p>After setting up the callback function, we <code>open</code> the request and submit it. In this example, we send a request to postman-echo which allows us to test sending a request as a client. The API will return a JSON response.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we execute this script, we will observe the API request's response being printed on the command line.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Next let's consider another example that interacts with file system via the <code>node:fs</code> library (which is a builtin module).</p> <pre><code>import { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\nconst txt = \"hello\";\nwriteFile(\"save.txt\", txt, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>At line 2, we define the text data to be written to the file.</li> <li>At line 3, we write the result to a file named <code>save.txt</code>, note that <code>writeFile()</code> takes three arguments. The last argument is a callback function, whose argument <code>err</code> is potentially an error. In this case, when the error is present, we propagate the error by throwing it as an exception, otherwise, we print a message.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"%0D/l4_2_nodejs/#callback-pyramid","title":"Callback Pyramid","text":"<p>Let's say now we would like to combine the two examples, first we would like to make an API call, when the call is returned successfully, we save the result of the API call into a file.</p> <pre><code>import XMLHttpRequest from \"xhr2\";\nimport { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\n\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nvar args = process.argv;\nif (args.length &gt; 2) {\n  var input = args[2];\n  xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {\n    if (xhr.readyState == 4) {\n      var res = xhr.responseText;\n      writeFile(\"api_result.txt\", res, (err) =&gt; {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n      });\n    }\n  };\n  xhr.open(\"GET\", `https://postman-echo.com/get?x=${input}`);\n  xhr.send();\n} else {\n  console.log(\"USAGE: node index.js input\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that we have to \"embed\" the routine of writing the result <code>res</code> into a file <code>api_result.txt</code> deep inside the callback of <code>xhr</code> request, the <code>writeFile()</code> call itself has another callback.

The function body of executor is executed synchronously while <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> are asynchronous and queued into microtask. Look at the simple <code>Promise</code> example below which is not using <code>reject</code>, but only <code>resolve</code>.</p> <pre><code>// executor is executed synchronously when promise object is initialized with \"new\" keyword.\n// Console will print \"Hello\" when this code below is run\nlet alwaysWork = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  resolve();\n});\n\n// resolve() and reject() functions are the argument passed to .then() or .catch()\nalwaysWork.then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Explanations:</p> <ul> <li><code>function (resolve, reject) { console.log(\"Hello\"); resolve();</code> is the executor.</li> <li>We can think of <code>Promise</code> in JS as this way: \"I want to run a piece of code (everything defined inside executor, synchronously). At the end of the code execution, I will either reach a success or failed state. If success, I would like to execute the <code>resolve()</code> function, otherwise I will execute <code>reject()</code>. I don't know yet what is the <code>resolve()</code> function. It will be provided when a function is passed as an argument to <code>.then()</code>. Same thing for <code>reject()</code>, which depends on function passed to <code>.catch()</code>\".</li> <li>In the example above, we use the anonymous function for <code>resolve()</code>, which is <code>() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\")</code>. This function is queued into microtask.</li> <li>However, it is logical that <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> can be a code that queues task to macrotask (e.g. you can have <code>setTimeout()</code> inside the function argument for <code>.then()</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider a more complicated example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(++count);\n  });\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter.then(incr).then(incr).then(incr);\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>In the above we instantiate an asynchronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable <code>count</code> and return a promise object that immediately <code>resolve</code> with the variable.</li> <li>Do you notice that we use closure here?</li> <li>Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the argument of <code>.then</code>. In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the new promise while incrementing <code>count</code> by 1.</li> <li>Fun-but-important fact: you can simply write the return statement of <code>incr()</code> function as <code>return ++count;</code>. JavaScript intrisically turn the returned value as a promise object resolved with returned value. We use this approach sometimes in the notes.</li> </ul> <p>When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes so that the we will stop incrementing the counter when a limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr()</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (count &gt; 1) {\n      reject(\"limit reached\");\n    } else {\n      resolve(++count);\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call.</p> <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n</code></pre> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>You might argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here.</p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function and creating a second counter.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(id) {\n  return function (count) {\n    console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      if (count &gt; 1) {\n        reject(\"limit reached\");\n      } else {\n        resolve(++count);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter1 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter1\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nlet counter2 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter2\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\nconsole.log(\"main done!\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle. Note that <code>nextTick()</code> queue the callback to macrotask. When executing the above example, we observe</p> <pre><code>main done!\nc1:0\nc2:0\nc1:1\nc2:1\nc1:2\nc2:2\nrejected: limit reached.\nrejected: limit reached.\ntick!\n</code></pre> <p>It reveals that the execution of the <code>incr</code> method calls for both promise objects are interleaved. The <code>tick</code> message shows that all these happens in one single event loop cycle because all the microtask from <code>promise</code> are executed before dequeueing macro task from the <code>nextTick()</code>. We will discuss what happen behind the scene in the next section.</p>"},{"location":"%0D/l4_2_nodejs/#nodejs-run-time-model","title":"Node.js run-time model","text":""},{"location":"%0D/l4_2_nodejs/#browser-vs-nodejs-runtime-revisit","title":"Browser vs NodeJS runtime (revisit)","text":"<p>Recall from the previous class, we studied the JavaScript run-time in the browser, which has a call stack, a heap, an event registry and a callback queue.</p> <ol> <li>The run-time executes the JavaScript main program in the call stack until no more stack frame left, and goes into the event loop.</li> <li>When there is an event triggered, the callback function associated with the event (in the event registery) will be added to the callback queue.</li> <li>In an event loop cycle, when there is no more frame in the call stack but there is some item in the call back queue, the run-time will dequeue the callback from the queue and add it to the call stack.</li> </ol> <p>In node.js runtime model, there are two callback queues:</p> <ol> <li>The macro task queue, which is same as the callback queue that stores callback associated with events.</li> <li>The micro task queue, which stores callbacks associated with promises.</li> </ol> <p>Given that promises are special builtin of node.js run-time, they are treated \"differently\" when executed.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code>. Open <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</code> in a browser. It will display the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically. With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"%0D/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

In this case, we expect that the route handler will return a list of objects containing <code>title</code> and <code>messages</code> attributes. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into a sequence of list items <code>li</code>.

We define  * a <code>get_bal()</code> promise builder function which returns a promise that resolves on the account's balance. * a <code>set_bal()</code> promise builder function which returns a promise that updates the account's balance.</p> <p>Next we define a <code>transfer()</code> function which transfer some amount from two accounts, by calling <code>get_bal()</code> and <code>set_bal()</code> <pre><code>async function transfer(src, dst, amt) {\n    let src_bal = await get_bal(src);\n    let dst_bal = await get_bal(dst);\n    if (src_bal &gt; amt) {\n        await set_bal(dst, dst_bal + amt); \n        await set_bal(src, src_bal - amt);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Finally, we define our main function and the aftermath observation  <pre><code>async function main() {\n    await transfer(b, a, 100);\n    await transfer(c, a, 50);\n}\n\nmain().then(\n    async function () {\n        let bal_b = await get_bal(b);\n        let bal_a = await get_bal(a);\n        let bal_c = await get_bal(c);\n        console.log(bal_a,bal_b,bal_c);\n    }\n)\n</code></pre> In the <code>main()</code> function, we sequentially transfer 100 from <code>b</code> to <code>a</code> then transfer 50 from <code>c</code> to <code>a</code>. </p> <p>We observe the closing balances as <code>250 100 100</code>.</p> <p>This is fine because the two transfer operations were carried out in sequence, (enforced by two <code>await</code>).</p> <p>Suppose we change the <code>main</code> function as follows, </p> <pre><code>async function main() {\n    transfer(b, a, 100);\n    await transfer(c, a, 50);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>or </p> <p><pre><code>async function main() {\n    await Promise.all([\n        transfer(b, a, 100),\n        transfer(c, a, 50)\n    ]);\n}\n</code></pre> In either way, the two transfer operations are performed concurrently, i.e. the promises are now interleaved. When we observe the closing balances as <code>150 100 100</code>. A racing condition is triggered.</p> <p>One may argue that the above variants of <code>main()</code> are unusual, after some code review, we perhaps can eliminate the bugs. However, in the event that the two transfer operations are triggered from separate server events, e.g. from two different HTTP request handlers, such a racing condition is inevitable.</p>"},{"location":"_/l12_2_code_std/#concurrency-control-at-the-database-level","title":"Concurrency Control at the database level","text":"<p>We can address such a data racing condition at the database level.

The following diagram shows the call stack with three frames when the program execution point is right before <code>return z*2</code>.</p> <p><pre><code>graph LR;\n    id1(\"g(11)\")\n    id2(\"f(10)&lt;br/&gt;y=11\")\n    id3(main)</code></pre> As <code>g(11)</code> call returns we remove the top most frame, i.e. <code>g(11)</code>, then back to the frame <code>f(10)</code>.  <pre><code>graph LR;\n    id2(\"f(10)&lt;br/&gt;y=11\")\n    id3(main)</code></pre> We return <code>22</code> as result and remove the second frame, <code>f(10)</code>.  <pre><code>graph LR;\n    id3(main)</code></pre> Lastly, we remove the <code>main</code> frame as we reach to the end of the program.</p> <p>Things become more interesting in the presence of call-back functions associated with some UI elements.  Recall one of our earlier examples, <pre><code>function handleButton1Click() {\n    var textbox1 = document.getElementById(\"textbox1\");\n    var span1 = document.getElementById(\"span1\");\n    span1.innerHTML = textbox1.value;\n}\nfunction run() {\n    var button1 = document.getElementById(\"button1\");\n    button1.addEventListener(\"click\", handleButton1Click); \n}\ndocument.addEventListener( \"DOMContentLoaded\", run);\n</code></pre> The program contains three portions, the two function definitions and a statement. JavaScript run-time in the browser executes them sequentially and synchronously, in the <code>main</code> call frame. To illustrate the step by step program execution let's consider the following table. The first column is the program counter. The second column captures the call stack, for simplicity, we use python's style list to represent a stack, where the left most element the bottom frame. The third column is a mapping from (UI) events to call-back functions, we use Python's style dictionary syntax. The fourth coulumn is the callback queue (again we use python's list style)</p> program counter (line num) call stack event reg table callback queue 1 [main] {} [] 6 [main] {} [] 10 [main] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code> : <code>run</code>} [] <p>The run-time first execute the function declaration in line 1, in call frame <code>main</code>, which does not affect the event registeration table nor the callback queue. Similar observation applies when it move on to execute the function declaration in line 6. When the program counter is at line 10, we are add the last statement of the main program. Add an event listener to the even <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>, which creates an entry to the even registration table, mapping <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> to the function <code>run</code> as callback. After line 10, the call stack becomes empty as <code>main</code> ended. However the JavaScript run-time for rendering this web page is still running. It is executing an event-loop, in which it periodically check whether there is anything is the callback queue. At this point in time the browser continues to render the HTML page. When the HTML document is fully rendered, the browser triggers an <code>DomContentLoaded</code> event. At this point the callback function <code>run</code> associated with the event is enqueued to the callback queue.  Since the call stack is empty and the callback queue is not, the JavaScript run-time dequeues <code>run</code> from the callback queue and creates a call frame in the call stack. It continues to move the program counter from lines 7-9.</p> program counter (line num) call stack event reg table callback queue ... ... ... ... [] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>} [<code>run</code>] 7 [<code>run</code>] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>} [] 8 [<code>run</code>] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>} [] 9 [<code>run</code>] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code>  : <code>run</code>, <code>button1.click</code> : <code>handleButton1Click</code> } [] <p>At the end of line 9, a new event (<code>button1</code> being clicked) is being registered, mapping to <code>handleButton1Click</code>. The call stack becomes empty again. The JavaScript run-time goes into the event loop again, waiting for next event to take place. </p> <p>When someone clicks on the button <code>button1</code>, the callback function <code>handleButton1Click</code> will be enqeued into the callback queue. The run-time will \"move\" it into the call stack to execute it.</p>"},{"location":"_/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#we-have-purposely-ignored-something","title":"We have purposely ignored something ...","text":"<p>Actually, besides the callback, there are something called promises which enable JavaScript code to support asynchronous programming.

(We don't need to import it when the code is executed in the browser as all browser has <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class builtin in the run-time, but this is not the case for node.js). In the second statement, we instantiate an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object.  In the third line, we read the command line arguments into a variable <code>args</code>. The following <code>if-else</code> statement check whether the user supplies enough arguments.  In the then branch, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.  Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the state of the request changing. As we discussed earlier,  the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the callstack for execution.  In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is  done, we extract the response text and print it out. After setting up the callback function, we open the request and submit it.</p> <p>If we execute this script, we will observe the API request's repsonse being printed on the command line.</p> <p>Next let's consider another example that interacts with file system via the <code>node:fs</code> library (which is builtin). <pre><code>import { writeFile } from 'node:fs';\nconst txt = \"hello\";\nwriteFile('save.txt', txt, (err) =&gt; {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('The file has been saved!');\n}); \n</code></pre> In the second statement,we define the text data to be written to the file.

This function argument is called the executor. An executor function is a higher order function that takes two functions as arguments, commonly named as <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. <code>resolve</code> is applied to the result of the promise during normal execution, <code>reject</code> is applied when some error occurs, (cf. <code>throw</code>). In the following we instantiate a <code>Promise</code> object that always resolves.</p> <pre><code>let alwaysWork = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  resolve();\n})\n</code></pre> <p>Let's consider a more interesting example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter()  {\n    var count = 0;\n    return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        resolve(count);\n    });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n    console.log(count);\n    return ++count;\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n</code></pre> <p>In the above we instantiate an asychronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable and return a promise object that  resolves with the variable, recall that <code>resolve</code> is the continuation (i.e. the next  step of the promise). Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the parameter of <code>.then</code>.  In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the result of incrementing <code>count</code> by 1. One may point out that <code>incr</code> does not return a new Promise object, how could this work? Behind the scene, node.js rewrite the <code>incr</code> function as </p> <p><pre><code>function incr(count) {\n    console.log(count);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; resolve(++count));\n}\n</code></pre> When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2 \n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes to the example, so that the <code>incr</code> function will stop incrementing the counter when the limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n    console.log(count);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n        if (count &gt; 1) {\n            reject(\"limit reached\");\n        } else {\n            resolve(++count);\n        }\n    }); \n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call. <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .then( incr )\n    .catch( (reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`))\n</code></pre></p> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2 \nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>We now argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here. </p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function  and creating a second counter. </p> <p><pre><code>1: function asyncCounter()  {\n2:     var count = 0;\n3:     return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n4:         resolve(count);\n5:     });\n6: }\n7:\n8: function incr(id) {\n9:     return function (count) {\n10:        console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n11:        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n12:            if (count &gt; 1) {\n13:                reject(\"limit reached\");\n14:            } else {\n15:                resolve(++count);\n16:            }\n17:        }); \n18:    };\n19:}\n20:\n21:let counter1 = asyncCounter();\n22:\n23:counter1\n24:    .then( incr(\"c1\") )\n25:    .then( incr(\"c1\") )\n26:    .then( incr(\"c1\") )\n27:    .catch( (reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`))\n28: \n29:let counter2 = asyncCounter();\n30:\n31:counter2\n32:    .then( incr(\"c2\") )\n33:    .then( incr(\"c2\") )\n34:    .then( incr(\"c2\") )\n35:    .catch( (reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`))\n36:\n37:process.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\n38:console.log(\"main done!\")\n</code></pre> In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle.

The run-time executes the JavaScript main program in the call stack until no more stack frame left, and goes into the event loop.  2. When there is an event triggered, the callback function associated with the event (in the event registery) will be added to the callback queue.  3. In an event loop cycle, when there is no more frame in the call stack but there is some item in the call back queue, the run-time will dequeue the  callback from the queue and add it to the call stack. </p> <p>With the presence of <code>Promise</code>, there are more than one callback queues.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise. </p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require('http');\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req,res) =&gt; {\n  if(req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n  else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n})\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code> without a need to step an npm project structure. Open  <pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/\n</code></pre> in a browser will dipslay the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by registering its executor with the HTTP request event. </p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some  common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically.  With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"_/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require('express')\nconst app = express()\nconst port = 3000\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send('Hello World!')\n})\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)\n})\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

A HTML form capture the inputs from its child elements and converts into a form, where each input value is assocated with a name. Thus in the input text element, we added a name attribute <code>message</code>. For the button, we changed its type from <code>button</code> to <code>submit</code> to indicate that when  this button is clicked the form should be submitted. The <code>action</code> attribute of the form element indicate the destination of the end point, the method is HTTP POST. Below the form, we have an HTML order list element <code>ol</code>, whose content will be generated via the embedded javscript template language. In this case, we expect that the  route handler will return an object containing a <code>title</code> and a <code>messages</code> list. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into  a sequence of list items <code>li</code>. Within each <code>li</code> element, we render the message's time and text.</p> <p>Next we update the <code>routes/echo.js</code> as follows <pre><code>const express = require('express'); // existing\nconst model = require('../models/message.js'); // existing\nvar router = express.Router(); // existing\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\nrouter.get('/:msg', async function(req, res, next) { // existing\n    const msg = req.params.msg;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nrouter.get('/', async function(req, res, next) { // updated\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\",'messages': messages});\n});\n\nrouter.post('/submit', async function(req, res, next) { // new\n    const msg = req.body.message;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\", 'messages': messages});\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router; // existing\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the second routing rule, we listen to the local URL path <code>/echo/</code>, and retrieve all the messags, and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template. This is to handle  user accessing  <pre><code>http://localhost:3000/echo\n</code></pre> In the third routing rule, we liste ot the local URL path <code>/echo/submit</code> over HTTP POST, we retrieve the message (via element name attribute = \"message\"), create a new message, retrieve all the messages from the model and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template.</p> <p>Being different from HTTP GET, parameters of the requests submited via HTTP POST are packaged into the body of the request instead of being exposed as part of the URL.  Technically speaking, users can't access a HTTP POST endpoint directly via the browser URL links or navigation bar. </p> <p>To allow the form data embeded in the HTTP POST request to be parsed, we add the following to the <code>app.js</code></p> <pre><code>const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); // new \napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // new\n\napp.use('/', indexRouter); // existing\napp.use('/users', usersRouter) // existing\n</code></pre> <p></p>"},{"location":"_/l6_1_expressjs_frontend/#approach-2-using-ajax","title":"Approach 2 Using AJAX","text":"<p>The advantage of Approach 1 is that it is relatively simple to implement and codes are pretty structured. One issue with Approach 1 is that the page <code>echoform</code> is reloaded each time we submit a new message.  This is not a big deal when the page is simple with little content. It affects the user experience as the content of the page get complex and a single click would cause the entire page to refresh. </p> <p>To address this issue, we could use AJAX.  The idea of AJAX is to divide the view template HTML into sub regions, when a user input is detected, we use the client side javascript to update the affected sub region. </p> <p>We re-start from the point of <code>echo.ejs</code> template again.

Element without child/content can be written in a short form, e.g. <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;</code> is a short hand of <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;</code>.

The fourth coulumn is the callback queue (again we use python's list style)</p> line num call stack event reg table callback queue 1 [main] {} [] 6 [main] {} [] 10 [main] { <code>DomContentLoaded</code> : <code>run</code>} [] <p>The run-time first execute the function declaration in line 1, in call frame <code>main</code>, which does not affect the event registration table nor the callback queue. Similar observation applies when it move on to execute the function declaration in line 6. When the program counter is at line 10, we are add the last statement of the main program. Add an event listener to the even <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>, which creates an entry to the even registration table, mapping <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> to the function <code>run</code> as callback. After line 10, the call stack becomes empty as <code>main</code> ended. However the JavaScript run-time for rendering this web page is still running. It is executing an event-loop, in which it periodically check whether there is anything is the callback queue. At this point in time the browser continues to render the HTML page. When the HTML document is fully rendered, the browser triggers an <code>DomContentLoaded</code> event. At this point the callback function <code>run</code> associated with the event is enqueued to the callback queue. Since the call stack is empty and the callback queue is not, the JavaScript run-time dequeues <code>run</code> from the callback queue and creates a call frame in the call stack. It continues to move the program counter from lines 7-9.</p> program counter (line num) call stack event reg table callback queue ... ... ... ...

(We don't need to import it when the code is executed in the browser as all browser has <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> class builtin in the run-time, but this is not the case for node.js).</li> <li>In the second statement, we instantiate an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> request object.</li> <li>In the third line, we read the command line arguments into a variable <code>args</code>. Remember that we can pass the argument when executing the file. For example, if the filename is <code>index.js</code>, then we can execute <code>node index.js abcd</code> in the terminal. In this example, <code>abcd</code> is the command line argument.</li> <li>The following <code>if-else</code> statement checks whether the user supplies an argument. The <code>node</code> and <code>index.js</code> are counted, so the length must be 3.</li> <li>In the <code>if</code> body, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.</li> <li>Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the HTTP Request state is changed. As we discussed earlier, the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the call stack for execution. Read about <code>.onreadystatechange</code> here and <code>readyState</code> property here. Basically, HTTP request has several states, and the last state is state 4 (DONE) which means that the data transfer has been completed (response received) or failed.</li> <li>In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is done, we extract the response text and print it out.</li> <li> <p>After setting up the callback function, we <code>open</code> the request and submit it. In this example, we send a request to postman-echo which allows us to test sending a request as a client.

This function argument is called the executor. An executor function is a higher order function that takes two functions as arguments, commonly named as <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. <code>resolve</code> is applied to the result of the promise during normal execution, <code>reject</code> is applied when some error occurs. The function body of executor is executed synchronously while <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> are asynchronous and queued into microtask. Look at the simple <code>Promise</code> example below which is not using <code>reject</code>, but only <code>resolve</code>.</p> <pre><code>// executor is executed synchronously when promise object is initialized with \"new\" keyword.\n// Console will print \"Hello\" when this code below is run\nlet alwaysWork = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  resolve();\n});\n\n// resolve() and reject() functions are the argument passed to .then() or .catch()\nalwaysWork.then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Explanations:</p> <ul> <li><code>function (resolve, reject) { console.log(\"Hello\"); resolve();</code> is the executor.</li> <li>We can think of <code>Promise</code> in JS as this way: \"I want to run a piece of code (everything defined inside executor, synchronously). At the end of the code execution, I will either reach a success or failed state. If success, I would like to execute the <code>resolve()</code> function, otherwise I will execute <code>reject()</code>. I don't know yet what is the <code>resolve()</code> function. It will be provided when a function is passed as an argument to <code>.then()</code>. Same thing for <code>reject()</code>, which depends on function passed to <code>.catch()</code>\".</li> <li>In the example above, we use the anonymous function for <code>resolve()</code>, which is <code>() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\")</code>. This function is queued into microtask.</li> <li>However, it is logical that <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> can be a code that queues task to macrotask (e.g. you can have <code>setTimeout()</code> inside the function argument for <code>.then()</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider a more complicated example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(++count);\n  });\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter.then(incr).then(incr).then(incr);\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>In the above we instantiate an asynchronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable <code>count</code> and return a promise object that immediately <code>resolve</code> with the variable.</li> <li>Do you notice that we use closure here?</li> <li>Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the argument of <code>.then</code>. In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the new promise while incrementing <code>count</code> by 1.</li> <li>Fun-but-important fact: you can simply write the return statement of <code>incr()</code> function as <code>return ++count;</code>. JavaScript intrisically turn the returned value as a promise object resolved with returned value. We use this approach sometimes in the notes.</li> </ul> <p>When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes so that the we will stop incrementing the counter when a limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr()</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (count &gt; 1) {\n      reject(\"limit reached\");\n    } else {\n      resolve(++count);\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call.</p> <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n</code></pre> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>You might argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here.</p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function and creating a second counter.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(id) {\n  return function (count) {\n    console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      if (count &gt; 1) {\n        reject(\"limit reached\");\n      } else {\n        resolve(++count);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter1 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter1\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nlet counter2 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter2\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\nconsole.log(\"main done!\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle. Note that <code>nextTick()</code> queue the callback to macrotask. When executing the above example, we observe</p> <pre><code>main done!\nc1:0\nc2:0\nc1:1\nc2:1\nc1:2\nc2:2\nrejected: limit reached.\nrejected: limit reached.\ntick!\n</code></pre> <p>It reveals that the execution of the <code>incr</code> method calls for both promise objects are interleaved. The <code>tick</code> message shows that all these happens in one single event loop cycle because all the microtask from <code>promise</code> are executed before dequeueing macro task from the <code>nextTick()</code>.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise. </p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require('http');\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req,res) =&gt; {\n  if(req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n  else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n})\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code> without a need to step an npm project structure. Open  <pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/\n</code></pre> in a browser will dipslay the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by registering its executor with the HTTP request event. </p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some  common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically.  With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"_/notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require('express')\nconst app = express()\nconst port = 3000\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send('Hello World!')\n})\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)\n})\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

A connection pool allows us to regular the resource usage for database operations. </p> <p>The rest are similar to the one we learned using mongodb.</p> <p>Next in the same folder (<code>models</code>), create a file named <code>message.js</code> with the following content. </p> <p><pre><code>const db = require('./db.js');\n\nconst tableName = 'message';\n\nclass Message {\n    constructor(msg, time) {\n        this.msg = msg;\n        this.time = time;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function sync() {\n    try {\n        db.pool.query(`\n        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ${tableName} (\n            msg VARCHAR(255),\n            time DATETIME PRIMARY KEY\n        )\n        `);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"database connection failed. \" + error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function all() {\n    try {\n\n        const [rows, fieldDefs] = await db.pool.query(`\n            SELECT msg, time FROM ${tableName}\n        `);\n        var list = [];\n        for (let row of rows) {\n            let message = new Message(row.msg, row.time);\n            list.push(message);\n        }\n        return list;\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"database connection failed. \" + error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function insertOne(message) {\n    try {\n\n        const [rows, fieldDefs] = await db.pool.query(`\n            INSERT INTO ${tableName} (msg, time) VALUES (?, ?)\n        `, [message.msg, message.time]);\n\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"database connection failed. \" + error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nasync function insertMany(messages) {\n    for (let message of messages) {\n        await insertOne(message);\n    }\n}\n\n\nmodule.exports =  { Message, all, sync, insertOne, insertMany }\n</code></pre> Similar to how <code>my_mongo_app</code>, we define a class <code>Message</code> to model each message received and saved. MySQL data must be stored in a table with schema definition. We define a <code>sync</code> function which creates the table in the database if it is not there. This function will be called in the <code>app.js</code> when the web app starts. We provide a set of functions. </p> <ul> <li>Function <code>all</code> retrieves all the messages from the table.</li> <li>Function <code>insertOne</code> inserts a message using the INSERT statement. In this case we find two <code>?</code>s in the statement, these two question marks are the placeholders for the verified values. In this case <code>message.msg</code> and <code>message.time</code> will be subsituted in the statement if they are valid. The <code>mysql2</code> library will verify that the values substituting <code>?</code> do not contain illegal characters which might cause some security issues, (which will be discussed in some class later).</li> <li>Function <code>insertMany</code> inserts a list of messages.</li> </ul> <p>Next we create a <code>routes/echo.js</code> file with the following content, </p> <p><pre><code>const express = require('express');\nconst model = require('../models/message.js');\nvar router = express.Router();\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\n\nrouter.get('/:msg', async function(req, res, next) {\n    const msg = req.params.msg;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre> which is similar to what we have seen in the <code>my_mongo_app</code>.</p> <p>Finally, in the <code>app.js</code> file, we include the following </p> <pre><code>var logger = require('morgan');\n// adding the following\nconst db = require('./models/db.js');\nconst process = require('process');\n\nprocess.on('SIGINT', db.cleanup);\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', db.cleanup);\nconst message = require('./models/message.js');\nmessage.sync();\n// end\n</code></pre> <p>We imported the <code>db.js</code> file we created and <code>process</code> library so that we can register the <code>db.cleanup</code> function as the callback when the web app terminates.

A HTML form capture the inputs from its child elements and converts into a form, where each input value is assocated with a name. Thus in the input text element, we added a name attribute <code>message</code>. For the button, we changed its type from <code>button</code> to <code>submit</code> to indicate that when  this button is clicked the form should be submitted. The <code>action</code> attribute of the form element indicate the destination of the end point, the method is HTTP POST. Below the form, we have an HTML order list element <code>ol</code>, whose content will be generated via the embedded javscript template language. In this case, we expect that the  route handler will return an object containing a <code>title</code> and a <code>messages</code> list. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into  a sequence of list items <code>li</code>. Within each <code>li</code> element, we render the message's time and text.</p> <p>Next we update the <code>routes/echo.js</code> as follows <pre><code>const express = require('express'); // existing\nconst model = require('../models/message.js'); // existing\nvar router = express.Router(); // existing\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\nrouter.get('/:msg', async function(req, res, next) { // existing\n    const msg = req.params.msg;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nrouter.get('/', async function(req, res, next) { // updated\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\",'messages': messages});\n});\n\nrouter.post('/submit', async function(req, res, next) { // new\n    const msg = req.body.message;\n    const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n    await model.insertMany([message]);\n    const messages = await model.all();\n    console.log(messages);\n    res.render(`echoform`, { 'title': \"Echo App\", 'messages': messages});\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router; // existing\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the second routing rule, we listen to the local URL path <code>/echo/</code>, and retrieve all the messags, and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template. This is to handle  user accessing  <pre><code>http://localhost:3000/echo\n</code></pre> In the third routing rule, we liste ot the local URL path <code>/echo/submit</code> over HTTP POST, we retrieve the message (via element name attribute = \"message\"), create a new message, retrieve all the messages from the model and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template.</p> <p>Being different from HTTP GET, parameters of the requests submited via HTTP POST are packaged into the body of the request instead of being exposed as part of the URL.  Technically speaking, users can't access a HTTP POST endpoint directly via the browser URL links or navigation bar. </p> <p>To allow the form data embeded in the HTTP POST request to be parsed, we add the following to the <code>app.js</code></p> <pre><code>const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); // new \napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // new\n\napp.use('/', indexRouter); // existing\napp.use('/users', usersRouter) // existing\n</code></pre> <p></p>"},{"location":"_/notes/l6_1_expressjs_frontend/#approach-2-using-ajax","title":"Approach 2 Using AJAX","text":"<p>The advantage of Approach 1 is that it is relatively simple to implement and codes are pretty structured.

It affects the user experience as the content of the page get complex and a single click would cause the entire page to refresh. </p> <p>To address this issue, we could use AJAX.  The idea of AJAX is to divide the view template HTML into sub regions, when a user input is detected, we use the client side javascript to update the affected sub region. </p> <p>We re-start from the point of <code>echo.ejs</code> template again.

The <code>screen</code> object allows us to make reference to the screen rendered in the test environment.  The <code>getByText()</code> method takes a regex pattern which search for the text \"submit\" in upper or lower cases. The result is stored in the variable <code>button</code>. Finally we assert that the button can be found in the rendered document.  We argue that the above test case is leaning towards the visual test category. </p> <p>We recall another component used in the <code>Echo</code> app, <code>MessageList</code>. </p> <pre><code>function MessageList({messages}) {\n    let rows = [];\n    for (let i in messages) {\n        rows.push(\n            &lt;tr key={messages[i].time}\n                data-testid={messages[i].time}&gt;\n                &lt;td&gt;{messages[i].time}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{messages[i].msg}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n        );\n    }\n    return (\n        &lt;table data-testid=\"message-list\"&gt;\n            &lt;tbody&gt;\n                &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Message&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n                {rows}\n            &lt;/tbody&gt;\n        &lt;/table&gt;\n    )\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For the ease of reference, we give some test ids to the data rows and the table.  We now can derive the following case.  <pre><code>test('No message is rendered in empty MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgs = [];\n    render(&lt;MessageList messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(table.firstElementChild.children.length == 1); // only contains the header row.\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the above test case, we render a <code>MessageList</code> component with an empty message list.  We expect the table's <code>tbody</code> element should contains only one row, which is the the header row.</p> <p>In the next test case, we instantiate a <code>MessageList</code> component with a singleton message list and expect that the  table should contains the message. <pre><code>test('A message is rendered in a singleton MessageList', () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"hello\";\n    const msgTime = (new Date()).toString();\n    const msg = { time : msgTime, msg: msgTxt };\n    const msgs = [msg];\n    render(&lt;MessageList \n            messages={msgs} /&gt;);\n    const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n    const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n    expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n    expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n    expect(table.contains(row));\n});\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note that both of the test cases are functional tests.</p> <p>Finally let's consider testing the <code>Echo</code> component. Recall that,</p> <pre><code>function Echo({http_addr}) {\n    const [msgTxt, setMsgTxt] = useState(\"\");\n    function handleSubmitClick() {\n        submitNewMessage();    \n    }\n    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);\n\n    async function submitNewMessage() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/submit`,\n        {\n            method: 'POST',\n            body: `msg=${msgTxt}`,\n            headers: {\n                'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\n            }              \n        });\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n\n    async function initMessages() {\n        const response = await fetch(`${http_addr}/echo/all`);\n        const text = await response.text();\n        const json = JSON.parse(text);\n        setMessages(json);\n    }\n\n    useEffect( () =&gt; {\n        initMessages();\n    }, []);\n\n    return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n            &lt;NewMessageBar message={msgTxt} onMessageChange={setMsgTxt} onSubmitClick={handleSubmitClick}/&gt;\n            &lt;MessageList messages={messages}/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code snippet, we abstract the backend API URL via the <code>http_url</code> variable, for ease of mocking the API host.</p> <p>We define two test cases of the <code>Echo</code> component in the <code>Echo.test.js</code> test file as follows.</p> <pre><code>import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport './jest.polyfills'\nimport {http, HttpResponse} from 'msw'; \nimport {setupServer} from 'msw/node';\nimport Echo from './Echo';\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n    http.get('/echo/all', () =&gt; {\n      return HttpResponse.json(\n        [{'msg':'hello','time':'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'}])\n    }),\n    http.post('/echo/submit', () =&gt; {\n        return HttpResponse.json(\n          [{msg:'hello',time:'2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z'},\n           {msg:'bye', time:'2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z'}\n          ])\n      }),\n    )\n\nbeforeAll(() =&gt; server.listen())\nafterEach(() =&gt; server.resetHandlers())\nafterAll(() =&gt; server.close())\n\n\ntest('testing initMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-24T04:24:49.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n\n});\n\ntest('testing submitNewMessage() in Echo', async () =&gt; {\n    const msgTxt = \"bye\";\n    render(&lt;Echo http_addr='' /&gt;);\n    const textbox = screen.getByLabelText('echo-message');\n    const submitButton = screen.getByText(/submit/i);\n    fireEvent.change(textbox, {target: {value: msgTxt}});\n    await userEvent.click(submitButton);\n    expect(textbox.value).toBe(msgTxt);\n    await waitFor( () =&gt; {\n        const msgTime = '2024-06-25T00:12:30.000Z';\n        const table = screen.getByTestId(\"message-list\");\n        const row = screen.getByTestId(msgTime);\n        expect(table).toBeInTheDocument(); // the table must be rendered.\n        expect(row).toBeInTheDocument(); // the row must be rendered.\n        expect(table.contains(row));\n    }); \n})\n</code></pre> <p>As we want to isolate the test from the backend API, we need to mock the API calls. This is achieved by using the library <code>msw</code>. </p> <p>Due to some API deprecation, to import <code>msw</code> with versions of Jest and React we are currently using we need to introduce some extra configuration for Jest in <code>jest.polyfills</code>. For details setup, please refer to this file.</p> <p><code>setupServer()</code> functions allows us to define a mock backend API server with the required endpoints.  The first test case <code>'testing initMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the first rendering of the <code>Echo()</code> component.  We want to ensure that the table contains a row with the message returned by the mocked API <code>/echo/all</code>.  The second test case <code>'testing submitNewMessage() in Echo'</code> is to test the user action of entering the message \"bye\" in the textbox and clicking the submit button.

We only consider HTML5 in this unit. An HTML document consists of a doctype declaration, which tells the browser which version of HTML it is in. The second part is an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>Each element consists of an open tag and a close tag and the children. For instance, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is the opening tag and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> is the closing. The children of an elemnent can be elements or texts. However there are a set of rules governing what contents could appear in a given element. In the above example, the content of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element consists of a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. Element without child/content can be written in a short form, e.g. <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;</code> is a short hand of <code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;</code>. Note that <code>charset=\"utf-8\"</code> denotes an attribute of this <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element.</p> <p>The HTML document in the above example defines a structure as follows,</p> <ul> <li>html</li> <li>head<ul> <li>meta</li> <li>title</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> <li>body<ul> <li>paragraph</li> <li>text</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#css","title":"CSS","text":"<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a language used in describing the presentation of a document. Being different from HTML, it focuses on the aesthetical requirement of the documents.

Each rule consists of two parts.</p> <ol> <li>terms preceding the <code>{</code> are called the selectors.</li> <li>terms being enclosed by <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> are called the declarations.</li> <li>Each declaration consists of a property (preceding the colon <code>:</code>) and a value (following the colon <code>:</code>).</li> <li>Declarations are terminated by a semi colon <code>;</code>.</li> </ol> <p>For instance, in the first rule, we find <code>p</code> as the selector, which means that this rule is applicable to all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements in the target HTML document. For all applicable elements, we want to set the margin to be 10 pixel wide. The second rule applies to a particular element with id = <code>#msg1</code>. Note that ids in an HTML document must be unique. In this rule, we want to set the font family of the text contained in the applicable elements to <code>Courier New</code>. In the third rule, we would like to apply the declaration to all elements with <code>class</code> attribute equal to <code>heading</code>.</p> <p>Suppose the above css definitions are stored in a file named <code>hello.css</code>, we could add the following as one of the child element of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element in the earlier html document.</p> <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;50.003&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"hello.css\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"heading\"&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p id=\"msg1\" class=\"message\"&gt;It's about Software Engineering!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Note that selectors are composable, e.g. selector <code>p.heading</code> selects all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements with <code>class</code> equal to <code>heading</code>.</p> <p>For information refers to</p> <pre><code>https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"notes/l4_1_web_prog_common_js/#overlapping-css-rules","title":"Overlapping CSS rules","text":"<p>Suppose we add a new CSS rule to the earlier CSS</p> <pre><code>p {\n  margin: 10px;\n}\n\n#msg1 {\n  font-family: \"Courier New\", Courier, monospace;\n}\n\n.heading {\n  font-size: larger;\n}\n// new rule\np.message {\n  margin: 5px;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The first and the newly added rules are overlapping, i.e. the set of HTML elements they select are overlapping, i.e.</p> <pre><code>&lt;p id=\"msg1\" class=\"message\"&gt;It's about Software Engineering!&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>is selected by both rules.

Remember that we can pass the argument when executing the file. For example, if the filename is <code>index.js</code>, then we can execute <code>node index.js abcd</code> in the terminal. In this example, <code>abcd</code> is the command line argument.</li> <li>The following <code>if-else</code> statement checks whether the user supplies an argument. The <code>node</code> and <code>index.js</code> are counted, so the length must be 3.</li> <li>In the <code>if</code> body, we extract the third argument, which will be used as the input parameters in the API call.</li> <li>Before calling the API, we set-up a callback in the event of the HTTP Request state is changed. As we discussed earlier, the node.js run-time has an event loop, which periodically checks for events (Phase 4). In this case, the change of state in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is one of the events it is checking. When the event occurs, i.e. the state of the object changes, the callback function will be placed in the callback queue. When the main call stack is empty, the callback will be put into the call stack for execution. Read about <code>.onreadystatechange</code> here and <code>readyState</code> property here. Basically, HTTP request has several states, and the last state is state 4 (DONE) which means that the data transfer has been completed (response received) or failed.</li> <li>In the callback function, we check whether the state is <code>4</code>, which stands for <code>DONE</code>. When the call is done, we extract the response text and print it out.</li> <li> <p>After setting up the callback function, we <code>open</code> the request and submit it. In this example, we send a request to postman-echo which allows us to test sending a request as a client. The API will return a JSON response.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we execute this script, we will observe the API request's response being printed on the command line.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Next let's consider another example that interacts with file system via the <code>node:fs</code> library (which is a builtin module).</p> <pre><code>import { writeFile } from \"node:fs\";\nconst txt = \"hello\";\nwriteFile(\"save.txt\", txt, (err) =&gt; {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\"The file has been saved!\");\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>At line 2, we define the text data to be written to the file.</li> <li>At line 3, we write the result to a file named <code>save.txt</code>, note that <code>writeFile()</code> takes three arguments.

This function argument is called the executor. An executor function is a higher order function that takes two functions as arguments, commonly named as <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. <code>resolve</code> is applied to the result of the promise during normal execution, <code>reject</code> is applied when some error occurs. The function body of executor is executed synchronously while <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> are asynchronous and queued into microtask. Look at the simple <code>Promise</code> example below which is not using <code>reject</code>, but only <code>resolve</code>.</p> <pre><code>// executor is executed synchronously when promise object is initialized with \"new\" keyword.\n// Console will print \"Hello\" when this code below is run\nlet alwaysWork = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  resolve();\n});\n\n// resolve() and reject() functions are the argument passed to .then() or .catch()\nalwaysWork.then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Explanations:</p> <ul> <li><code>function (resolve, reject) { console.log(\"Hello\"); resolve();</code> is the executor.</li> <li>We can think of <code>Promise</code> in JS as this way: \"I want to run a piece of code (everything defined inside executor, synchronously). At the end of the code execution, I will either reach a success or failed state. If success, I would like to execute the <code>resolve()</code> function, otherwise I will execute <code>reject()</code>. I don't know yet what is the <code>resolve()</code> function. It will be provided when a function is passed as an argument to <code>.then()</code>. Same thing for <code>reject()</code>, which depends on function passed to <code>.catch()</code>\".</li> <li>In the example above, we use the anonymous function for <code>resolve()</code>, which is <code>() =&gt; console.log(\"Comes later\")</code>. This function is queued into microtask.</li> <li>However, it is logical that <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> can be a code that queues task to macrotask (e.g. you can have <code>setTimeout()</code> inside the function argument for <code>.then()</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider a more complicated example using <code>Promise</code>.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(++count);\n  });\n}\n\nlet counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter.then(incr).then(incr).then(incr);\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li>In the above we instantiate an asynchronous counter by calling the function <code>asyncCounter()</code>, which initializes a local variable <code>count</code> and return a promise object that immediately <code>resolve</code> with the variable.</li> <li>Do you notice that we use closure here?</li> <li>Next we invoke <code>.then</code> method of this counter (promise) three times. We can chain the invocation because, <code>.then</code> method takes a method and returns a new promise. In this case, we use the <code>incr</code> function as the argument of <code>.then</code>. In the <code>incr</code> function, we print the <code>count</code> variable and return the new promise while incrementing <code>count</code> by 1.</li> <li>Fun-but-important fact: you can simply write the return statement of <code>incr()</code> function as <code>return ++count;</code>. JavaScript intrisically turn the returned value as a promise object resolved with returned value. We use this approach sometimes in the notes.</li> </ul> <p>When we execute the above we will see the following printed on the terminal.</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\n</code></pre> <p>Now let's make some changes so that the we will stop incrementing the counter when a limit is reached. We modify the <code>incr()</code> function as follows,</p> <pre><code>// definition of asyncCounter() remains unchanged.\nfunction incr(count) {\n  console.log(count);\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    if (count &gt; 1) {\n      reject(\"limit reached\");\n    } else {\n      resolve(++count);\n    }\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above, <code>incr</code> returns a new promise object which does not always resolve with <code>++count</code>. In the event that the current <code>count</code> value is greater than 1, it will reject the rest of the computation, by applying <code>reject</code>.</p> <p>Now coming back to the use of the <code>counter</code>, we chain it with <code>incr</code> 4 times, followed by a call to a <code>catch()</code> method invocation and consumes the error raised by any of the <code>reject</code> function call.</p> <pre><code>let counter = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .then(incr)\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n</code></pre> <p>calling the above, we have</p> <pre><code>0\n1\n2\nrejected: limit reached.\n</code></pre> <p>You might argue that we don't experience any asynchronousness here.</p> <p>Let's modify the example by attaching a prefix to the message printed by the <code>incr</code> function and creating a second counter.</p> <pre><code>function asyncCounter() {\n  var count = 0;\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n    resolve(count);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction incr(id) {\n  return function (count) {\n    console.log(`${id}:${count}`);\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\n      if (count &gt; 1) {\n        reject(\"limit reached\");\n      } else {\n        resolve(++count);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nlet counter1 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter1\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c1\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nlet counter2 = asyncCounter();\n\ncounter2\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .then(incr(\"c2\"))\n  .catch((reason) =&gt; console.log(`rejected: ${reason}.`));\n\nprocess.nextTick(() =&gt; console.log(\"tick!\"));\nconsole.log(\"main done!\");\n</code></pre> <p>In the 2nd last statement, we call <code>process.nextTick()</code> which prints a <code>tick!</code> message at the next event loop cycle. Note that <code>nextTick()</code> queue the callback to macrotask.

We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument.

One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically. With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

This phase is also known as logical modelling (and subsequently physical modelling).</p> <p>Let's consider the modelling the ER diagram with <code>Staff</code> and <code>Dept</code> and <code>Work</code> relationship (without the <code>Manage</code> relation).</p> <p>There are more than one possible logical models:</p> <p>Approach one: Storing <code>Dept</code> as a collection, which has attributes <code>code</code> and <code>staff</code>. <code>code</code> is a string, <code>staff</code> is a list of objects. Each object in <code>staff</code> is a document with <code>sid</code> and <code>name</code> as attributes. e.g.</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"code\": \"HR\",\n  \"staff\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"name\": \"aaron\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2,\n      \"name\": \"betty\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Approach two: Storing <code>staff</code> as a separate collection from <code>dept</code>. The <code>staff</code> attribute in the <code>dept</code> document should contains only the ids of the staff. A <code>dept</code> document</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"code\": \"HR\",\n  \"staff_ids\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A <code>staff</code> document contains <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>dept_code</code> attributes.</p> <pre><code> {\n   'id': 1,\n   'name': 'aaron'\n   'dept_code': 'HR'\n }\n</code></pre> <p>Both design will work. The advantage of the first approach is that all the information are now stored in one collection, it is easier to ensure the data consistency, while the downside is that as the conceptual model becomes complex, we might have documents with too many level of nesting. Approach two avoids the deep nesting of the document structure, however, to maintain the data consistency requires additional checking and validation in the application.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#cohort-exercises","title":"Cohort Exercises","text":"<p>Using MongoDB document example, can you give a logical design of the ER diagram with the <code>Staff</code> and <code>Dept</code> entities and <code>Work</code> and <code>Manage</code> relationships?</p> <p>Can you implement a web app with the correspondent end-point (routes) handlers to support</p> <ol> <li>add and update <code>staff</code></li> <li>add <code>dept</code></li> <li>find <code>staff</code>s by department code</li> <li>find <code>staff</code>s by staff id</li> </ol>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo-ECCLT2203802%E2%80%99s%20MacBook%20Pro/#some-special-cases-of-er-diagrams","title":"Some special cases of ER diagrams","text":"<p>There are some difficult cases of ER diagrams to be modeled in document database in general,</p> <p>For instance a ternery relationship below  For simplicity, we omitted the attributes of the entities.

These requests are often conveyed using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) or its secured variant (HTTPS). Given a request, the web application returns the correspondent response to the client. We can think of a web application takes a HTTP(s) request as input and returns a HTTP(s) response as result if the request is valid, returns an error response otherwise.</p> <p>A simple web application can be defined using the builtin <code>http</code> module in Node.js.</p> <p>Suppose we have a following Node.js script <code>simple_webapp.js</code></p> <pre><code>// import http from 'http' // won't work, not in a npm project\nconst http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst webAppServer = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  if (req.url === \"/\") {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Welcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Welcome to 50.003!&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  } else {\n    res.write(`\n        &lt;html&gt;\n            &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Error&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n            &lt;body&gt;Page not found&lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;`);\n    res.end();\n  }\n});\n\nwebAppServer.listen(3000);\n</code></pre> <p>In the program, we instantiate an http server object <code>webAppServer</code> by calling the constructor method <code>http.createServer()</code>, which takes an executor function as the argument. The executor function expects a request and a response as inputs and writes output (HTML) to the reponse. In the last statement, we start the web app server by calling <code>.listen(3000)</code>, i.e. the server is running on port 3000.</p> <p>We can start the web app by running <code>node simple_webapp</code>. Open <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</code> in a browser. It will display the welcome page.</p> <p>Recall that from our previous lesson, Node.js executes the given JavaScript program statement by statement until there is nothing left in the call stack, then it continues with the event loop. The event loop will check for timer functions (which is absent in the above), check the micro and macro task queues, poll the I/O, and etc. Until there is nothing pending callback or I/O. One may ask how comes our simple_webapp program remains running? The answer lies in the last statement, the <code>.listen()</code> method keeps the web server in the event-loop by having an active handler waiting for HTTP request event.</p> <p>One issue with the above implementation is that all the request to response mapping are defined in a single function and there is only one iteration. In real world projects, we need to decompose the web app into multiple modules and components to handle different functionalities, e.g. sigup/login, user profile, content access, payment and etc. Furthermore, there are some common operations which are to be performed in nearly all requests, e.g. checking whether the user has already login. Lastly, the formatting of the return response, i.e. HTML code, CSS and client side JavaScripts should be modularized and built up systematically. With these consideration in mind, we often prefer using some web application framework to guide the development instead of building everything from scratch for productivity concern.</p>"},{"location":"notes/l5_1_expressjs_backend_mongo/#expressjs","title":"Express.js","text":"<p>Express.js is one of the popular web application framework for Node.js.</p> <p>To use express.js</p> <pre><code>mkdir my_express_app\ncd my_express_app\nnpm init\nnpm i express\n</code></pre> <p>Then we add a file <code>app.js</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>At this stage, we have a web application created using express.js.

For the submit button, we can use <code>submit</code> type. The <code>action</code> attribute of the form element indicates the destination of the end point. Below the form, we have an HTML order list element <code>ol</code>, whose content will be generated via the embedded javscript template language. In this case, we expect that the route handler will return a list of objects containing <code>title</code> and <code>messages</code> attributes. By using a for loop, we expand the list of messages into a sequence of list items <code>li</code>. Within each <code>li</code> element, we render the message's time and text.</p> <p>Next we update the <code>routes/echo.js</code> as follows</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\"); // existing\nconst model = require(\"../models/message.js\"); // existing\nvar router = express.Router(); // existing\n\n/* GET echo listing. */\nrouter.get(\"/:msg\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // existing\n  const msg = req.params.msg;\n  const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n  await model.insertMany([message]);\n  const messages = await model.all();\n  console.log(messages);\n  res.send(`${JSON.stringify(messages)}`);\n});\n\nrouter.get(\"/\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // updated\n  const messages = await model.all();\n  res.render(`echoform`, { title: \"Echo App\", messages: messages });\n});\n\nrouter.post(\"/submit\", async function (req, res, next) {\n  // new\n  const msg = req.body.message;\n  const message = new model.Message(msg, new Date());\n  await model.insertMany([message]);\n  res.redirect(\"/echo\");\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router; // existing\n</code></pre> <p>In the second routing rule, we listen to the local URL path <code>/echo/</code>, and retrieve all the messages, and render the result in the <code>echoform</code> template.
